<p class="noindent">Sir Walter Scott and William Motherwell, it has been
recorded, both intended to do something towards the preservation
of the works and fame of the literary pedlar and bellman
of Glasgow: the former by reprinting the first edition of <em>The
History of the Rebellion</em>, and the latter by a history of the
Chap Literature of Scotland, in which, of course, Dougal
Graham should have been a prominent figure. Neither of
these eminent Scotsmen, however, found fitting opportunity
to carry their intentions into effect. This is all the more to
be regretted when it is considered that few men were better
able to undertake the task they had proposed for themselves.
In the fifty years that have elapsed since Scott and Motherwell
made the world acquainted with their abandoned projects,
no serious attempt has been made to preserve the
writings of Dougal Graham. These works have been
floating about the country in unconsidered fragments, and,
notwithstanding the efforts of a few gentlemen of the past
and present generations, have ever been in danger of utter
destruction.</p>

<p>The Editor of these volumes has endeavoured to combine
the intentions of Scott and Motherwell. After long and careful
search, he has been able to bring together extremely rare
and unique editions of Graham’s chap-books. Many of these
works are rich in illustration of the manners and customs of
the people during the period of their first publication; and the
Editor, by foot-notes, and otherwise, has tried to explain
obscurities, or trace the origin and development of peculiar
customs. He has also noted many passages containing valuable
contributions to the folk-lore literature of Scotland. The
various editions that have come under his notice have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
carefully collated; and while the oldest editions are here given,
any important differences between them and subsequent issues
have been marked. The Editor considered it no part of his
duty to ‘improve’ his author, for he believed that to the extent
he sought to effect such so-called ‘improvements,’ the
work would cease to be that of Graham. Every production
has been given, as far as could be found, in the condition in
which it proceeded from his pen; and by doing this the
Editor thought he would best perform his duty to his author
and to the public. A glossary of obsolete, or imperfectly
understood, words, has been given at the end of the second
volume.</p>

<p>In the prosecution of his labours, the Editor laid himself
under obligation to George Gray, Esq., Clerk of the Peace,
Glasgow, whose unequalled collection of the popular literature
of Scotland (many of the most valuable specimens having
once been in the possession of the late Dr. David Laing)
has been laid under heavy contribution; to Alex. Macdonald,
Esq., Lynedoch Street; Matthew Shields, Esq., Secretary
of the Stock Exchange, Glasgow; John Wordie, Esq.,
Buckingham Terrace; Prof. George Stephens, LL.D., F.S.A.,
Copenhagen; Thomas Gray, Esq., Ashton Terrace; and
John Alexander, Esq., West Regent Street. His thanks
are also due to J. Whiteford Mackenzie, Esq., W. S., Edinburgh;
J. T. Clark, Esq., Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh;
Bailie William Wilson, Glasgow; George W. Clark, Esq.,
Dumbreck; and James Richardson, Esq., Queen Street,
Glasgow.</p>

<p class="noindent">The negligence of contemporaries by failing to appreciate
the real worth of the great men of their time has often been
a subject of remark. No special case need be cited to give
point to the recurrence of the proposition here, for many such
instances will readily suggest themselves to the mind. The
reasons for this fact are many, and of divergent natures.
Though it is beyond the scope of the present inquiry to
discuss the general question, it may be observed, however,
that some of the more potent causes which in the past have
led to this unfortunate result are being rapidly removed
through the spread of knowledge among the great mass
of the people, and through the remarkable activity of the
press in its various branches. Personal gossip regarding the
hereditarily and individually great is now and then served
up to the public, and it is always received with unmistakable
relish. Autobiography, also, has become fashionable,
and this, within recent years, has often shed light upon
opinions and actions about which some doubts had formerly
existed. These and other circumstances, in themselves perhaps
not unmixed good, will tend to keep the biographers
of the great men of this and the last generation from being
placed in the awkward position in which almost all who
attempt to record the lives of men who have achieved local
or universal fame prior to the present century must at
times find themselves placed. Insufficient data is the great
obstacle in the way of the latter class. Traditions difficult to
credit and as difficult to refute; suggestions more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
probable; and many obscurities, all incline to make their
work perplexing, and, to a certain extent, unsatisfactory. Yet
the task must be undertaken, and the earlier the better, in
order that such scraps of information as have come down
from the past to the present may be preserved.</p>

<p>Dougal Graham, the literary pedlar and bellman of Glasgow,
like many a greater man, has suffered unmerited neglect, and
the value of his work was not discovered, or appreciated, until
it was almost too late to retrieve the loss involved by the
remissness of his contemporaries and immediate successors.
Motherwell, lamenting this fact, says very truly, ‘That a man
who, in his day and generation, was so famous, should have
left no dear recollections behind him; some Boswell to record
his life, actions, and conversation, need be subject of admiration
to no one who has reflected on the contemptuous neglect
with which Time often treats the most illustrious dead.’<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Graham was first noticed as having done something for the
literature of his country by Mr. E. J. Spence, of London, who
in 1811 published <em>Sketches of the Manners, Customs, and
Scenery of Scotland</em>. Motherwell, in the short-lived <em>Paisley
Magazine</em>, next set forth fully Graham’s title to the regard
of his compatriots, and rescued a few recollections concerning
him which, in the course of a year or two more, would
have been lost. M‘Vean, in the appendix to his edition
of M‘Ure’s <cite>History of Glasgow</cite>, issued in 1830, added a few
additional particulars. Then Dr. Strang, through the medium
of his work on <cite>Glasgow and its Clubs</cite>, contributed his mite to
the small collection of knowledge concerning our author.
Graham has provided only one or two details about himself;
an advertisement in a Glasgow newspaper fixes the date of
one of the most important events of his life; and Dr. Strang
has preserved some stanzas of an elegy on his death, written
by some unknown poetaster. There, practically, our knowledge
ceases. All beyond what is to be gained from these
sources is tradition or inference, and not a little of what has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
thus been put on record has been questioned. A ‘metrical
account of the author,’ according to an existing tradition, was
prefixed to an early issue of Graham’s <cite>History of the
Rebellion of 1745&ndash;46</cite>, but owing to the disappearance of the
first and second, and some of the subsequent editions, this
account, if it ever existed, can now afford no assistance, nor
can the tradition itself be traced to its source. Sir Walter
Scott felt interested in Dougal’s work, but unfortunately he
has contributed nothing to his biography, though it is believed
to have been his intention to have done so. Such being the
state of matters, it is only fair at this stage to assume that
comparatively few of the events in the life of Dougal Graham
have been ascertained beyond doubt, and that much that
is related about him might be overturned even by some
minute discovery. The probabilities, however, are against
such a happy occurrence at so remote a period. His career,
in so far as it is known, is not without a touch of romance,
and it furnishes the key to a proper acquaintance with his
works.</p>

<p>Graham, according to all accounts, was born in the village
of Raploch, near Stirling, in or about the year 1724. If, as
has been supposed, his <cite>History of John Cheap the Chapman</cite>
is autobiographical, this is his own story of that important
event&mdash;‘I, John Cheap by chance, at some certain time,
doubtless against my will, was born at the Hottom, near
Habertehoy Mill. My father was a Scots Highlandman,
and my mother a Yorkshire wench, but honest, which causes
me to be of a mongrel kind.’ Should this account be accurate,
the names of the places seem to be veiled; but the uncertainty
as to its application to Graham himself makes it of comparatively
little value. Unfortunately, Nature endowed him with
a deformed body, and his physical defects developed with his
growth. His parents, from their humble position in life, were
unable to give him anything beyond the common education
of the time, which was of a very scant description, but he
seems to have learned more by his native wit than by the
instructions of the schoolmaster. Taught no trade, his youth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
would probably be spent at farm work, or at such odd employment
as he could find, it may have been in the weaver’s shop,
or in the saw-pit, much the same, in all likelihood, as his father
had done before him, and as we may still find men doing in
remote country hamlets. Leaving the old home under the
shadow of Stirling Castle, Graham went in his early youth as a
servant to a small farmer in the neighbourhood of the quaint
little village of Campsie. A tradition regarding his residence
there lingered about the place for nearly a century, for Spence
saw traces of a turf cottage said to be the birth-place and early
residence of Dougal Graham.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> As there are no good grounds
for questioning the statement that Graham’s birth-place was
Raploch, may it not be considered a feasible idea, in view of
Spence’s remark, that our author’s parents removed to Campsie,
and that he went with them? How long Dougal remained
with the farmer is unknown. Of an unsettled disposition, he,
like his creation <em>John Cheap</em>, made himself a chapman when
very young, in great hopes of being rich when he became old;
and for some years he wandered over the country in the
exercise of his craft. The political events of the time, however,
effected another and more important change in his career,
and rapidly developed in him the mental capabilities with
which nature had, by way of compensation, endowed him.</p>

<p>The outbreak of the Jacobite Rebellion in 1745 found
Graham ready to follow the Young Chevalier. When the
Highland army was on its southward march, he joined it on
the 13th of September of that year, at the Ford of Frew, on
the Forth. At that time he was probably about twenty-one
years of age. The capacity in which he became attached to
the Prince’s forces has been matter for conjecture. His physical
deformities are assumed to have unfitted him for active
service, and everything points to the conclusion that he was
not a soldier, but rather a sutler, or camp-follower, blending,
probably, his political aspirations with commercial pursuits.
In the preface to his <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>, he avoids saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
he participated actively in the events he records, but plainly
states that he had ‘been an eye-witness to most of the movements
of the armies, from the rebels first crossing the Ford of
Frew to their final defeat at Culloden.’ Throughout the
whole course of the seven months’ campaign, Graham accompanied
the rebel army, and while he has carefully recorded
its movements, he has given no indication of how he himself
was occupied, or of any adventures that may have fallen to
his share. There can be little doubt that, to a man of his
temperament, the march to Derby and the retreat upon Inverness,
would be highly educative in its effects, by showing
him life in various parts of the country he had in all likelihood
never visited before, and by bringing him into contact
with men of all ranks. In this short period his knowledge of
men and manners would be largely increased, and the experience
thus gained would greatly facilitate the production of
those graphic and truthful descriptions which sometimes adorn&mdash;sometimes,
it must also be admitted, tarnish&mdash;the literary
efforts of his later years.</p>

<p>Until this time, Graham is not known to have made any
effort in the direction of literature, though, in view of the
magnitude of the task he set before himself on the conclusion
of the rebellion, it is not improbable he may have
courted the Muses from afar, and indulged in poetical, or
rhythmical, fancies for the amusement of his customers and
entertainers in his youthful chapman days. However that
may be, Dougal, immediately after the disaster at Culloden,
rapidly made his way homewards, and set about committing
to verse a narrative of the expedition of Prince Charles. The
self-imposed duty was great, but he was equal to it. The
battle of Culloden was fought on the 16th of April, 1746, and
five months later Graham’s work was announced. In the
<cite>Glasgow Courant</cite>, of the 29th September, the following advertisement
appeared:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘That there is to be sold by James Duncan, Printer in Glasgow, in the Saltmercat,
the 2nd Shop below Gibson’s Wynd, a Book intituled A full, particular,
and true Account of the late Rebellion in the Year 1745 and 1746, beginning with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the Pretender’s Embarking for Scotland, and then an Account of every Battle,
Siege, and Skirmish that has happened in either Scotland or England.</p>

<p>‘To which is added, several Addresses and Epistles to the Pope, Pagans, Poets,
and the Pretender: all in Metre. Price Four Pence. But any Booksellers or
Packmen may have them easier from the said James Duncan, or the Author, D.
Grahame.</p>

<p>‘The like has not been done in Scotland since the Days of Sir David Lindsay.’</p>
</div>

<p>There is every reason to believe that this work became
popular immediately on its publication. Scattered broadcast
over Scotland by chapmen and others, while the events of
which it treated were still agitating the minds of the people,
Graham’s name by it would be brought boldly to the front, and
there would be opened up for him the possibilities of a career
wider than any he could have contemplated under ordinary
circumstances. In every way the work appears to have been a
success, and the judgment pronounced upon it by Dr. Robert
Chambers has been concurred in by all who have read the
production&mdash;‘The poetry is, of course, in some cases a little
grotesque, but <em>the matter</em> of the work is in many instances
valuable. It contains, and in this consists the chief value of
all such productions, many minute facts which a work of more
pretension would not admit.’<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Sir Walter Scott’s estimate
of it was not less favourable, for, writing to Dr. Strang in
1830, he said&mdash;‘It really contained some traits and circumstances
of manners worth preserving.’<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Although the issue of the <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite> was probably
large, it is remarkable that now, and for many years
past, no copy of the first edition has been known to exist. It
would be difficult to explain the cause of such a total disappearance.
The fact must be regretted both from literary and
bibliographical points of view, for a copy of it, besides being
of interest in itself, would clear up several obscurities and differences
of opinion that have arisen in relation to it and subsequent
editions.</p>

<p>Prior to the publication of the <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Graham was not a resident in Glasgow, though it is probable
he would be known to many there, for he must have had frequent
occasion to visit the city for the purpose of purchasing
his stock-in-trade. These visits would bring him into contact
with booksellers, and the numerous tradesmen whose wares
would be represented in his miscellaneous pack. The title-page
of his work is said to have contained these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘Composed by the poet, D. Graham,</p>
<p class="verse0">In Stirlingshire he lives at hame.’</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">It would be useless to say whether the wide term ‘Stirlingshire’
bore reference to Raploch, or to Campsie, as has
been suggested; but the verse may fairly be considered, by
the prefix ‘poet’ to the author’s name, to give countenance
to the inference that Graham was not quite a tyro in the art
of verse-making, and that previous to the publication of his
<em>History</em> he was regarded by his intimate friends, at least, as
having qualified for the title. However that may be, Dougal
seems now to have made Glasgow his home. Possibly he still
continued to ply his calling as a pedlar; but he added to this
a profession for which his natural capabilities specially adapted
him. In Glasgow, he became the poet of passing events. Little
of local importance seemed to have escaped him, and the few
metrical pieces now extant, and attributed to him by various
authorities, can only be regarded as the representatives of an
extensive issue of facetious broadsides and chap-book ballads.
Among those believed to be referable to this period of his life,
are <cite>John Hielandman’s Remarks on Glasgow</cite>, and <cite>Turnimspike</cite>.
Although these have never been acknowledged by Graham
himself, in the formal way that he has acknowledged the authorship
of the <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>, there <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'is a concensus'">is a consensus</ins> of
opinion that these two poems are undoubtedly his production.
In them the acquaintance he made with Highland modes of
thought and expression during the progress of the Jacobite
campaign, served him in good stead. M‘Vean attributes a
humorous piece, entitled <cite>Tugal M‘Tagger</cite>, to Graham, but
this has been questioned on several grounds, perhaps the most
forcible suggestion being, that its style and rhythm are liker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the work of Alexander Rodger than of Graham. Personally,
we feel inclined to support M‘Vean, and that for a variety of
reasons, which may be better explained when dealing with
the bibliography of our author’s works; while other metrical
compositions of a similar character will also fall to be considered
under the same head.</p>

<p>Dougal was now a man of some note, and, in addition, he
is believed to have gradually worked himself into a position
of comparative freedom from pecuniary troubles. In the time
of his poverty he vented his ill nature on his Roman Catholic
fellow-subjects in verse far from elegant, charging them with
having brought about, for reasons best known to himself, the
unsatisfactory state of his exchequer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘You Papists are a cursed race,</p>
<p class="verse0">And this I tell you to your face;</p>
<p class="verse0">And your images of gold so fine,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their curses come on me and mine.</p>
<p class="verse0">Likewise themselves at any rate,</p>
<p class="verse0">For money now is ill to get.</p>
<p class="verse0">I have run my money to an en’,</p>
<p class="verse0">And have nouther paper nor pen</p>
<p class="verse0">To write thir lines the way you see me,</p>
<p class="verse0">And there’s none for to supplie me.’</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Like many another man, Graham becomes incoherent when
indulging in strong language. But matters did not always
remain in this sad state, and when he published the second
edition of his <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite> he was able to call himself
‘Dougal Graham, merchant,’ showing he had advanced a
step in his commercial position. There is no reason to suppose
he had a place of business, such as a shop or warehouse,
but the probability is that he had become one of the better
class of chapmen, whose packs contained a large variety of
finer goods than were usually hawked through the country.</p>

<p>The second edition of the <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite> was published
in 1752, probably with additions to include the adventures
of Prince Charles after the defeat at Culloden. This
edition, like the first, has disappeared, and at present no copy
is known to exist. The re-issue of his work would assist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Graham in his pecuniary affairs, and it is said that he was
able to begin a business which, even in these early days, would
require some little capital. According to M‘Vean, Graham,
after 1752, became a printer, and, like Buchan, the chronicler
of Peterhead, he composed his works and set them up at the
case without committing them to writing; or, as Strang puts
it, he was in the habit of at once spinning thought into typography.
Beyond that there is no information as to Dougal’s
experience at the printing trade, though it must suggest itself
as strange that so many of his chap-books should be issued
by other parties, by Mr. Caldwell of Paisley, for instance, who
is reported by Motherwell to have said:&mdash;‘We were aye fain
to get a haud of some new piece frae him.’</p>

<p>Like Sir Walter Scott, who took a great interest in him and
his works, Graham after a time appears to have turned his
attention more particularly to prose composition, indulging
rarely in verse. The period during which most of his prose
chap-books were written and issued was probably between
1752 and 1774, the latter being the date of the publication of
the third edition of his <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>; though one
or two are known to have appeared subsequent to that date.
These works would greatly add to his credit with the people,
and there can be no doubt that they had a most extensive
circulation. ‘A’ his works took weel,’ says Mr. Caldwell,
Motherwell’s informant, ‘they were level to the meanest
capacity, and had plenty o’ coarse jokes to season them. I
never kent a history of Dougal’s that stuck in the sale yet.’
Better testimony as to their popularity could scarcely be
desired; and that the author was awarded a share of the
favour his works received cannot be doubted. It has sometimes
been thought that several of his chap-books were to a
certain extent autobiographical&mdash;such, for instance, as <cite>John
Cheap the Chapman</cite>&mdash;but the absolute impossibility of separating
fact from fiction makes them of no value in this direction.
Whether printed by himself or others the number of his works
still known to exist prove him to have been a most prolific
writer, and it can be fairly assumed that, in a pecuniary sense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
they were successful. None of them appear to have been
published under Graham’s own name, but were either issued
anonymously or under a cognomen which would probably
be well understood in his own time as referring to him, such
as ‘The Scots’ Piper,’ ‘John Falkirk,’ and ‘Merry Andrew at
Tamtallon.’</p>

<p>An advertisement which appeared in the <cite>Glasgow Journal</cite> of
14th June, 1764, has raised the question of Graham’s domestic
relations. Everything known points to the conclusion that he
never entered into the conjugal yoke. The announcement
spoken of ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Notice.</span>&mdash;Whereas, Jean Stark, spouse to Dougal Graham, ale-seller, above
the Cross, Glasgow, has parted from her husband, he thinks it proper to inform
the public that she be inhibit by him from contracting debt in his name, or yet
receiving any debt due to him, after this present date.’</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It has been usual to assume that this advertisement had no
reference to our author, and, even though the names are the
same, we see no reason to dissent from the general verdict.
There is neither direct information nor obscure indication of
Graham having at any time been an ‘ale-seller.’ The
incident, however, has given Professor Fraser an opportunity
of pointing out a failing of Dougal’s&mdash;‘In one sense, he was
always a large dealer in spirits, but it is not so certain that he
was actually a publican.’<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Judging from his works, and if
the few traditions concerning him are to be accepted as
evidence on this point, he was not a teetotaller, but that in
itself was no remarkable circumstance in the times in which
he lived.</p>

<p>An event of the first importance in Graham’s life was his
appointment to the post of skellat bellman of the city of
Glasgow. One would naturally have thought that in this
matter at least there would have been no room for any dubiety
concerning the various circumstances of the appointment,
especially as it was to a post of some credit under one of the
most ancient municipal corporations in Scotland, but that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
not so. The ‘skellat’ bell, it may be explained, was the one
used for ordinary announcements by the town-crier, as the
‘mort’ bell was in use on the intimation of death. In former
times the crier, on obtaining possession of the two bells, had,
according to the Burgh Records, ‘to cum bund for the soume
of thrie scoir pundis’ Scots, or £5 sterling; and in addition
to the importance of the office, it was always regarded as
being of some pecuniary value. As the appointment was in
the gift of the magistrates, it is surprising that no notice is
taken in the Town Council Records of Graham’s incumbency.
Motherwell put himself to some trouble in this matter, and
wrote to Dr. Cleland, author of the <cite>Annals of Glasgow</cite>, then
Superintendent of Public Works in the city, requesting information.
In October, 1828, he received this reply&mdash;‘With
regard to Dougal Graham, I may safely say there is nothing
in the Records concerning him. This, from my own knowledge,
corroborated by Mr. Thomson, one of our Town-clerks,
who lately made an index of everything in the books for 150
years back.’ In order to satisfy himself on this point, the
editor of these volumes took advantage of the opportunity
kindly afforded him of going over the Burgh Records in the
Town Clerk’s Office, and a careful search over the Council
Minutes for a period of fully forty years was unproductive of
any result other than that recorded by Dr. Cleland. As to
the date of the appointment, therefore, some doubt exists.
Turner, a town officer of fully eighty years, told Cleland that
when he was a boy of about ten years of age, he remembered
Graham as bellman, and Motherwell infers from this statement
that our author was enjoying the whole emoluments of
office about 1750. M‘Vean, however, is of a different opinion,
and says Graham could not have been bellman earlier than
1770, ‘as an old gentleman remembers other four bellmen, who
held office before Dougal, and after the year 1764.’ Possibly
Turner’s memory may have been failing him in his old age,
and he may not have been accurate by ten or fifteen years.
M‘Vean was certainly in as good a position as any one to
ascertain the true version, and there seems no reason why his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
statement should not be accepted in preference to the haphazard
guess by Motherwell.</p>

<p>Tradition has it that Graham did not obtain the office
of bellman without some little difficulty, because of his connection
with the Jacobite movement. Here is the story
as given by Mr. Caldwell, the Paisley publisher:&mdash;‘In his
youth he was in the Pretender’s service, and on that account
had a sair faught to get the place o’ bellman, for the Glasgow
bailies had an illbrew o’ the Hielanders, and were just doun-richt
wicked against onybody that had melled wi’ the rebels;
but Dougie was a pawkey chield, and managed to wyse them
ower to his ain interests, pretending that he was a staunch
King’s man, and pressed into the Prince’s service sair against
his will, and when he was naithing mair than a hafflins callant,
that scarcely kent his left hand frae his richt, or a B frae a
bull’s fit.’ In addition to this subtle reasoning with the
magistrates, Dougal is said by some writers to have effected
very material alterations on the third edition of his <cite>History of
the Rebellion</cite>, published in 1774, in order to please the Whig
patrons of the office to which he aspired. Here is a difficulty
not easily overcome. Caldwell’s information was likely to be
correct, and it is further supported by the knowledge that
during the Jacobite risings the Glasgow bailies, and the
citizens generally, were staunch supporters of the House of
Hanover. The first thought that must suggest itself to the
mind is, that it was not at all likely that Graham would seek
to publish in Glasgow a Jacobite history of the Rebellion, at a
time when the city authorities were applying to Parliament
for an indemnification for the money and supplies levied on
them by the Prince and his army. But assuming that Graham
did publish a history of this complexion, we have M‘Vean’s
statement, to all appearance founded upon a personal knowledge
of the second edition&mdash;though he seems to regard it as
the first&mdash;in these words:&mdash;‘In 1752 Dougal talks of the rebels
with a great deal of virulence; in 1774 he softens his tone,
and occasionally introduces apologies for their conduct.’
Possibly no one of the present generation, or of the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
immediately preceding it, has ever seen a copy of this second
edition; and in the absence of other and more conclusive
evidence, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipse dixit</i> of M‘Vean must be accepted, and it
goes directly against the assumption that Graham changed
the political colouring of the third edition of his history to
please the Glasgow bailies. If his appointment as bellman
took place in 1750, as Motherwell, on what have been
considered too slender grounds, has suggested, there might
be some reason for entertaining the idea; but taking the
date given by M‘Vean as approximately accurate it seems
altogether out of the question. Caldwell, with his admitted
knowledge of the incident, does not even hint at such an
action on Graham’s part, but only supplies a very feasible
account of the explanation afforded to the magistrates. Then,
again, it could not be the case surely, if the bailies were
‘wicked against onybody that had melled wi’ the rebels,’
that the best way to appease them would be to introduce
into the <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite> apologies for the conduct of
those whom they regarded with such detestation. Dr. David
Laing, writing, apparently, with a personal acquaintance of
the second edition, says:&mdash;‘The second edition, 1752, bears,
“Printed for and sold by Dougal Graham, merchant in
Glasgow.” In the third edition, 1774, the work was entirely
re-written, and not improved.... The first edition is so
extremely rare, that only one copy is known to be preserved,
and, as a literary curiosity, it might be worth reprinting;
although it demolishes the fine story of the author’s difficulty
in obtaining the bellman’s place from the Glasgow bailies, on
account of his being a Jacobite, and having joined the Pretender’s
army.’<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But more than that, there are in the third
edition itself some lines which go against the notion of alterations
in respect of the colouring of the events recorded. In
‘The Author’s Address to all in General’ there is this
verse:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘Now, gentle readers, I have let ye ken,</p>
<p class="verse0">My very thoughts, from heart and pen,</p>
<p class="verse0">’Tis needless now for to conten’,</p>
<p class="verse8">Or yet controule,</p>
<p class="verse0">For there’s not a word o’t I can men’,</p>
<p class="verse8">So ye must thole.’</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">He then proceeds to describe barbarities on both sides, of
which he had been witness. In the preface also he says:&mdash;‘I
have no dread of any Body’s finding Fault with me for
telling the Truth, because Charles has no Sway here; Duke
William, once the Idol of the loyal British, is gone to the
House of Silence, and, I believe, if I should take the Liberty
to tell the Truth of him, no Body could blame me.’ The
contention here is not that Graham was not sufficiently worldly
to stoop to trimming, but rather that the undoubted alterations
made on the third edition were not of the character
many have imagined them to be. M‘Vean says that many
‘curious passages’ in the 1752 edition were suppressed in
the one of 1774, but he makes that statement with reference
to the toning down of the virulence against the rebels. Of
course the disappearance of the first and second editions precludes
the final and decided settlement of this not unimportant
question, but the arguments and citations now brought forward
can only lead to the impression that Graham made no
alterations on the political tone of the third edition of his
history in order to win the Glasgow bailies over to his cause.
There were alterations and amendments, but these, it may be
surmised, would be more of a literary than political character.
The suggestion that they were of a different nature appears
to have arisen from a mistaken notion of M‘Vean’s statement,
which notion, by some means or other, became connected
with the difficulty Graham had in obtaining the office of bellman.
The two together make a most probable story, but it
is a story which seems to be founded upon insufficient premises.
It is curious that a somewhat similar misunderstanding
arose with regard to Chambers’s <cite>History of the Rebellion of
1745&ndash;6</cite>, and that in order to put the public right, the author
had to pen such words as these, as a preface to his seventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
edition:&mdash;‘It has been customary to call it [this history] a
Jacobite history. To this let me demur. Of the whole
attempt of 1745 I disapprove as most men do.... But,
on the other hand, those who followed Charles Edward in his
hazardous enterprise, acted according to their lights, with
heroic self-devotion.... Knowing how these men did
all in honour, I deem it but just that their adventures should
be detailed with impartiality, and their unavoidable misfortunes
be spoken of with humane feeling. There is no other
Jacobitism in the book that I am aware of.’</p>

<p>But leaving the region of debate, it will be refreshing to
turn to a humorous story on record, as to the competition
Graham had to face before he became bellman. There were
many applicants for the situation, and the magistrates decided
that the merits of each should be put to a practical test. Accordingly
all the candidates were instructed to be present on
a certain day in the back-yard of the old Town’s Hospital,
then situated in what is now known as Great Clyde Street.
The magistrates were present as judges, and there were with
them, no doubt, many of the leading citizens to witness the
interesting spectacle. All the other competitors having shown
their skill with the bell, and demonstrated the quality of their
vocal powers, Dougal’s turn came. He entered into the spirit of
the contest, and his physical peculiarities would greatly assist
him. He rang the bell in a surprising manner, and called
out in stentorian tones&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘Caller herring at the Broomielaw,</p>
<p class="verse0">Three a penny, three a penny!’</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">adding, pawkily&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘Indeed, my friends,</p>
<p class="verse2">But it’s a’ a blewflum,</p>
<p class="verse0">For the herring’s no catch’d,</p>
<p class="verse2">And the boat’s no come.’</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The victory was his, and the other competitors were out of
the reckoning. He had shown himself every way suited for
the office&mdash;to be endowed with that ready wit which has always
been a characteristic of the true Scottish bellman&mdash;and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
accordingly invested with the official garments, and with the
magisterial authority to exercise his new calling. In the year
1774, probably two or three years after the events just related,
the third edition of Graham’s <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>, with
amendments, was published. This edition, like its predecessors,
was successful, and it is understood to be the last edition issued
during the author’s lifetime. Dougal, as an official of the Corporation
of Glasgow, had now become a personage of no little
importance in the community. These were not the days of
cheap advertisements, reaching half-a-million readers in a few
hours, or of posters and handbills apprising the lieges of meetings
and sales, or of the lost, stolen, and strayed. All this
Graham, with the aid of his bell, had to intimate to the public.
The ‘trial scene’ affords a specimen of the kind of work he
had to perform. He had also, to a certain extent, to act as
attendant on the magistracy. The story goes that Dougal
was on one occasion passing along the Gallowgate, making
some intimation or another. Several officers of the 42nd Highlanders,
then returned from the American War of Independence,
where their regiment had been severely handled by the
colonists, were dining in the Saracen’s Head Inn, situated at
the foot of the Dovehill. They knew Dougal of old, and they
thought to have a joke at his expense. One of them put his
head out of the window, and called to the bellman&mdash;‘What’s
that you’ve got on your back, Dougal?’ This was rather a
personal reference, for Dougal had the misfortune to be
‘humphie backit.’ But he was not put out by the question,
for he at once silenced his interrogator by answering&mdash;‘It’s
Bunker’s Hill; do you choose to mount?’ The good stories
about Graham are said to have been legion, but they have,
unfortunately, been allowed to die out; otherwise, a collection
of his jokes and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bons mots</i> might have been a formidable rival
to the now classical <cite>Joe Miller</cite>.</p>

<p>But death put an end to Dougal’s happy-go-lucky existence
while he was still in the prime of life. He died on the 20th
of July, 1779, at the age of fifty-five or fifty-six, in what circumstances,
or of what trouble, cannot now be discovered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
These were not the days of newspaper obituaries, or he would
certainly have been awarded a half-column notice. This, of
itself, is unfortunate, for then many biographical details could
have been obtained, and subsequent writers of Graham’s life
would have been able to produce a record of his career more
satisfactory to themselves and their readers. That Dougal did
not die unregretted, is witnessed by an elegy of twelve stanzas,
written at the time of his death by some unknown poetaster.
This lament has, unfortunately, only come down to the present
generation in a fragmentary form, Dr. Strang<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> having

<p>In concluding this biographical notice of Dougal Graham,
it will be appropriate to make one or two quotations which
will give a full and just idea of his personality. Our author
seems to have taken a portrait of himself&mdash;and through his
modesty it is not too flattering&mdash;when he thus delineates
<em>John Cheap, the Chapman</em>:&mdash;‘John Cheap the chapman,
was a very comical short thick fellow, with a broad face and
a long nose; both lame and lazy, and something leacherous
among the lasses; he chused rather to sit idle than work at
any time, as he was a hater of hard labour. No man needed
to offer him cheese and bread after he cursed he would
not have it; for he would blush at bread and milk, when
hungry, as a beggar doth at a bawbee. He got the name of
John Cheap the chapman, by his selling twenty needles for
a penny, and twa leather laces for a farthing.’ Mr. Caldwell,
of Paisley, told Motherwell that ‘Dougald was an unco glib
body at the pen, and could screed aff a bit penny history in
less than nae time. A’ his warks took weel&mdash;they were level
to the meanest capacity, and had plenty o’ coarse jokes to
season them. I never kent a history of Dougald’s that stack
in the sale yet, and we were aye fain to get a haud of some
new piece frae him.’ Dr. Cleland, on the information of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Turner, an old Glasgow town-officer, was able to supply
Motherwell with this notice:&mdash;‘When Turner was a boy of
about ten years of age, Dougald was bellman, and being very
poetical, he collected a crowd of boys round him at every
corner where he rang the bell. Turner says that Dougald
was “a bit wee gash bodie under five feet.”’ ‘John Falkirk’
is believed to have been a nickname assumed by, or applied
to, Graham upon various occasions, and this description of
him is prefixed to one of the editions of <cite>John Falkirk’s
Cariches</cite>, published soon after his death:&mdash;‘John Falkirk,
commonly called the <em>Scots Piper</em>, was a curious little witty
fellow, with a round face and a broad nose. None of his
companions could answer the many witty questions he proposed
to them, therefore he became the wonder of the age in
which he lived.... In a word, he was</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseqq">‘“The wittiest fellow in his time,</p>
<p class="verse0">Either for Prose or making Rhyme.”’</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">M‘Vean says:&mdash;‘Dougal was lame of one leg, and had a large
hunch on his back, and another protuberance on his breast.’
Strang, referring to the portrait prefixed to the third edition
of the <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>, and reproduced in this volume,
thus pictures Graham: ‘Only fancy a little man scarcely five
feet in height, with a Punch-like nose, with a hump on his
back, a protuberance on his breast, and a halt in his gait,
donned in a long scarlet coat nearly reaching the ground,
blue breeches, white stockings, shoes with large buckles, and
a cocked hat perched on his head, and you have before you
the comic author, the witty bellman, the Rabelais of Scottish
ploughmen, herds, and handicraftsmen!’ But here is an even
more graphic pen and ink portrait, some of the details, no
doubt, filled in from imagination, but with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</i>
admirably preserved, and true to life:&mdash;‘It must have been a
goodly sight to see Dougal in his official robes, the cynosure
of every eye in the busy Trongate, or the life and soul of the
company in Mrs. M‘Larty’s “wee bit public,” where he and his
cronies were wont to quench their native thirst. He must,
indeed, have been a grotesque figure. “A wee bit gash body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
under five feet high;” with a round, broad, red and much-seamed
face; a prominent nose, truncated <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la Punch</i>; an
Æsopian hump on one shoulder, and a large protuberance on
one breast; legs of unequal length and peculiar shape; a long
scarlet coat hanging down from the shoulders to the ground;
blue breeches set off by white stockings, and large brilliantly
buckled shoes: with an imposing cocked hat perched fiercely
on one side of the massive head.’<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>These word paintings, together with the two portraits given
in this work, will afford the reader a most vivid conception of
the appearance of the king of Scottish chapmen.</p>

<h3 class="fs80"><a name="II_THE_WRITINGS" id="II_THE_WRITINGS"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">II.&mdash;THE WRITINGS OF DOUGAL GRAHAM.</a></h3>


<p>It must be manifest, from all that has been stated in the
preceding pages, that anything like a complete bibliography of
the works of Dougal Graham is now impossible. This is the
case for many reasons, kindred in their nature to those that
have rendered an absolutely satisfactory biography unattainable;
but more especially because, with the exception of the
<cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>, Graham did not formally, on title-pages
or elsewhere, acknowledge the authorship of the ballads and
prose chap-books attributed to him on more or less trustworthy
authority. Another important point is that he did
not seem to have interfered in any way with their re-issue after
their first publication, for there is evidence that in his life-time
editions were published in various places, other than Glasgow
and Paisley, to all appearance independent of the author.</p>

<p>Motherwell, in this as in other matters relating to Graham,
acting under the inspiration of information given him by Mr.
George Caldwell, the Paisley publisher, ascribes the following
works to Dougal, adding the dates of the earliest editions he
had in his possession when he wrote his article for the <cite>Paisley
Magazine</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>Leper the Tailor. Two parts. Glasgow, 1779.</p>

<p>The Comical History of Simple John and his Twelve Misfortunes.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Motherwell adds that ‘John Falkirk’s Jokes and Cariches’
and ‘Janet Clinker’s Orations’ were frequently found printed
together, and that the last named was sometimes issued as a
separate publication, with the title&mdash;‘Grannie M‘Nab’s Lecture
in the Society of Clashing Wives, Glasgow, on Witless Mithers
and Dandy Daughters, who bring them up to hoodwink the
men, and deceive them with their braw dresses, when they
can neither wash a sark, mak’ parritch, or gang to the well.’
In addition to the works already enumerated, Motherwell
mentions the following, regarding which he says that though
he had no authority for ascribing them to Graham he would
not be surprised to find that he was the author of them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pad6 fs80">
Merry Exploits of George Buchanan.<br />
The Creelman’s [Coalman’s] Courtship.<br />
The History of Buckhaven.<br />
</div>

<p>This concludes Motherwell’s testimony; and here is that
given by Mr. M‘Vean, the antiquarian bookseller, whose
authority can be scarcely less valid than that of the Paisley
Poet. Dr. Strang says:&mdash;‘In a manuscript of the late Mr.
M‘Vean, the antiquarian bibliopole of the High Street, we
find the following list of the <em>Opera Dugaldi</em>, so far as he had
met with them, keeping out of view his lyrical productions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
which were very numerous. Perhaps no man ever devoted
more time to ferret out bibliographical curiosities connected
with Scotland than Mr. M‘Vean....’:&mdash;</p>

<p>18. A Second Warning to the Methodist Preachers.</p>
</div>

<p>Strang himself, who, in some respects, must be regarded as
an authority upon matters relating to Graham, does not
condescend upon bibliographical details; and the lists now
given consequently include the testimony of the only two
writers whose opinions or suggestions bear with anything like
direct authority on the subject.</p>

<p>Two poems entitled <cite>John Hielandman’s Remarks on Glasgow</cite>
and <cite>Turnimspike</cite> have been unhesitatingly attributed to
Graham by all authorities; <cite>Tugal M‘Tagger</cite>, another
metrical production, was believed by M‘Vean to be his composition,
though there has been some subsequent questioning
in the matter; while the following have been claimed or
suggested as his work by M‘Vean, in a note to his edition of
M‘Ure’s <cite>History of Glasgow</cite>:&mdash;Verses on the Pride of Women, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
poem on the Popular Superstitions of Scotland, a Dialogue
between the Pope and the Prince of Darkness, and an epitaph
on the Third Command. Professor Fraser, in his list, inserts
<cite>Proverbs on the Pride of Women</cite>, in addition to the verses on
the same subject; but he gives no authority for the addition.</p>

<p>Having thus traced the results of the labours of those who
have already written concerning Graham’s miscellaneous
works, something must now be said about his <cite>History of the
Rebellion</cite>. The total disappearance of the first and second
editions of that curious publication renders, as has already
been hinted, any statements or opinions regarding them
of doubtful value, with the exception, of course, of the
date of their issue to the public. The advertisement announcing
the intended issue of the first edition in 1746, has been
quoted, and is undeniably authentic; but whether the work
was published immediately after, or some time later, is a moot
point. That it was published in that year is indicated by
what follows, which is believed to be the contents of the title-page
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">editio princeps</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘A full, particular, and true Account of the Rebellion, in the years 1745&ndash;6.</p>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Composed by the Poet D. Graham,</p>
<p class="verse0">In Stirlingshire he lives at hame.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">To the Tune of <em>The Gallant Grahams</em>. To which is added, Several other Poems
by the same Author. Glasgow, Printed and Sold by James Duncan, &amp;c., 1746.
Price fourpence halfpenny.’</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This edition was a duodecimo consisting of 84 pp. Probably
the matter it contained, assuming no alterations of this
portion, would end with the ninth chapter of later issues, the
last lines of which form an appropriate conclusion to the fatal
adventure of Prince Charles:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘This was a day of lamentation,</p>
<p class="verse0">Made many brave men leave their nation.</p>
<p class="verse0">Their eyes were open’d, all was vain,</p>
<p class="verse0">Now grief and sorrow was their gain.’</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">It may be interesting to note that the published price of this
edition, was, if the title-page quoted is authentic, a halfpenny
more than that at which it was announced; but that is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
trivial affair compared with what is suggested by the words&mdash;‘To
the Tune of <em>The Gallant Grahams</em>.’ This may be taken
as indicating that the matter of the first edition was not
altogether got up in the purely historical method, but that
it was to a certain extent what might be called either an historic
drama, or a dramatic history. This idea may not be accurate,
but the apparent impossibility of referring to the first edition
itself precludes any definite knowledge on the subject. Fraser,
speaking of the disappearance of this edition, remarks:&mdash;‘Yet,
at least a few copies of the original history <em>must</em> be
hidden somewhere. So late as 1830, the author of “Waverley”
had one in his possession, a fac-simile of which he intended to
publish, with the view of presenting it to the Maitland Club,
but sickness intervened to derange his plans, and two years
later, death stepped in and snatched the pen from the great
magician.’<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Again, Dr. David Laing says:&mdash;‘The first
edition is so extremely rare that only one copy is known to
be preserved, and, as a literary curiosity, it might be worth
reprinting.’<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It is to be regretted that Dr. Laing’s statement
was not more explicit. As for the assumption made by
Professor Fraser, it is only natural to imagine that the whole
edition cannot have altogether disappeared, and that a copy
or two should still be in existence. But he takes for granted
regarding Sir Walter Scott’s intentions, and his preparedness
to carry them into effect, rather more than the words of Dr.
Strang, on which he seems to have founded, will legitimately
bear. This is what Strang says:&mdash;‘So late as the year 1830,
Sir Walter Scott even “entertained the idea of printing a correct
copy of the original edition,” with the view of presenting it
to the Maitland Club as his contribution, stating, as he did in a
letter addressed to the writer, that he thought “it really contained
some traits and circumstances of manners worth preserving.”’<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Scott’s intention is here evident, but it in no way bears
that he was in possession of a first edition. In point of fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
he had no copy of it at the time of his death, two years after
this letter was written, as a reference to the catalogue of the
Abbotsford Library will show. That catalogue contains this
reference to Graham’s History:&mdash;‘Graham’s (Dougal, Bellman
of Glasgow) Impartial History of the Rise, Progress, and
Extinction of the late Rebellion, &amp;c. (in doggrel verse). 3rd
edit. 18mo. Glasgow: 1774.’ So far for the first edition.</p>

<p>As for the second edition of the <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>,
published in 1752, it has also disappeared. There is no
reason to believe that, beyond a slight enlargement and some
few alterations, there was any material change in the work.
Its tone is indicated by the remark made by M‘Vean:&mdash;‘<cite>The
History of the Rebellion</cite>, published by Dougal in 1752, differs
very much from the third edition, published in 1774. This
last appears to have been greatly altered and enlarged, and
many curious passages in the early edition are suppressed
in this. In 1752 Dougal talks of the rebels with a great deal
of virulence, in 1774 he softens his tone, and occasionally
introduces apologies for their conduct. In 1752 Dougal styles
himself “merchant in Glasgow;” a rhyming merchant could
not be expected to be rich, and he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">“You Papists are a cursed race,”’ &amp;c.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The lines, of which the one quoted is the first, have already
been given in the biography, and there is no need for their
repetition here. But it is worthy of note that M‘Vean states,
to a certain extent indirectly, that they formed part of the
matter in the second edition, and if that is the case they, it
must be admitted, fully confirm his statement as to that
edition containing passages in which Graham talked of the
rebels with a great deal of virulence; and, possibly, they may
be taken as specimens of many others of a like nature. Some
writers have suggested that Graham may have learned the
printing trade while this edition was passing through the
press, and it has been suspected that he may have had something
to do with the printing of it himself. That is not likely,
or M‘Vean, who appears to have had a somewhat intimate
acquaintance with the work, would have mentioned it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>No such doubts, however, exist as to the third edition of
the <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>, which, though rare, may be seen
occasionally. It was published in 1774, and bears on the
title-page this lengthy statement of its contents:&mdash;‘An Impartial
History of the Rise, Progress and Extinction of the
late Rebellion in Britain, in the years 1745 and 1746, giving
an account of every Battle, Skirmish, and Siege, from the
time of the Pretender’s coming out of France, until he landed
in France again: with Plans of the Battles of Prestonpans,
Clifton, Falkirk, and Culloden, with a real Description of
his Dangers and Travels through the Highland Isles, after
the Break at Culloden. By D. Graham. The Third Edition,
with Amendments. Glasgow: Printed by John Robertson.
<span class="fs70">MDCCLXXIV.</span>’ The narrative in this edition occupies 174 pp.
It consists of fifteen chapters, containing in all 5562 lines, and
is preceded by a preface of two pages, the title-page, and
a full-page woodcut of the author, bearing underneath it this
couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘From brain and pen, O virtue drope,</p>
<p class="verse0">Vice fly as Charlie, and John Cope.’</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">At the conclusion of the narrative are&mdash;‘A Quaker’s Address
to Prince Charles, shewing what was the Cause and Ground
of his Misfortunes,’ of 146 lines; a copy of ‘The Rebels’
Orders before the Battle of Culloden’; ‘Miss Flora’s Lament&mdash;A
Song,’ of ten four-line stanzas; ‘The Author’s Address
to all in general,’ of fourteen six-line stanzas; and two pages
of contents&mdash;making a total of 192 pages. The text of the
third edition has been used in the reprinting of the <cite>History of
the Rebellion</cite> for this volume.</p>

<p>The subsequent editions, so far as they have been discovered,
need only be mentioned. No trace has been found
of the fourth edition, though it must have been published soon
after Graham’s death. The fifth edition received this notice
from a writer of last century:&mdash;‘In 1787, “An impartial history
of the rebellion in Britain, in the years 1745 and 1746,
by Douglas Graham” (the fifth edition), was printed at Glasgow
by J. &amp; M. Robertson. This history is in Hudibrastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
metre. This is a sorry performance.’<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The seventh edition
was published in Glasgow by J. &amp; M. Robertson, Saltmarket,
in 1803; the eighth by the same firm in 1808; the
ninth in Falkirk, by T. Johnston, 1812; while the last, what
its number it would be difficult to say, was published in
Aberdeen, in 1850, conjointly by Alexander Watson and
Alexander Murdoch. The Aberdeen edition does not bear
Graham’s name on the title-page, and instead of the author’s
preface, it contains a ‘Genealogical and Historical Introduction,’
taken from the introduction to Chambers’s <cite>History of
the Rebellion</cite>. It is remarkable that the Advocates’ Library,
Edinburgh, should only possess an eighth edition.</p>

<p>Something must now be said about the miscellaneous poetical
works of Dougal Graham. The best known of these may
be said to be <cite>John Hielandman’s Remarks on Glasgow</cite>, a
humorous sketch of considerable power, valuable also, because
of the information it affords regarding the leading features of
the City of St. Mungo in the middle of last century. M‘Vean
has put it on record that this poem had long been popular,
although it was not generally known that it was by Graham
that Glasgow had been ‘married to immortal verse.’<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The
date of its first publication is unknown, but it has been generally
supposed to have been written in the decade subsequent
to Dougal’s settlement in Glasgow in 1746. The earliest
copy that has been seen by any writer was in one of the early
penny broadsides issued by J. &amp; M. Robertson, of the Saltmarket,
Glasgow, who long occupied a prominent position
as publishers of popular literature. As a literary production
<em>John Hielandman</em> has not attracted so much notice as
might have been expected from writers on Scottish literature,
but even a casual glance will show that it is a composition of
great merit, abounding in graphic touches and humorous
situations. It must be admitted, however, that the interest
attaching to it has been almost entirely local, and to that
circumstance may be attributed the fact that its merits have
been frequently overlooked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p><cite>Turnimspike</cite> has received more attention than any other of
Graham’s poems, with the exception, perhaps, of his <cite>History
of the Rebellion</cite>; and it has obtained the unqualified approval
of all the literary antiquaries who have had occasion to speak
of it. Sir Walter Scott said the <cite>Turnimspike</cite> alone was
sufficient to entitle Graham to immortality.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Dr. Charles
Mackay has taken advantage of a note upon it, to tell a story
which has considerable bearing upon the state of feeling
exhibited in the poem itself. ‘Turnimspike, or Turnpike,’
he says, ‘is ludicrously descriptive of the agonies of a real
Highlander at the introduction of toll gates, and other paraphernalia
of modern civilisation, into the remote mountain
fastnesses of his native land. Long after the suppression of
the Rebellion, great consternation was excited in Ross-shire, by
the fact that a sheriff’s officer had actually served a writ in
Tain. “Lord, preserve us!” said an Highlandman to his
neighbour, “What’ll come next? The law has reached Tain.”’<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Burns, in his <cite>Strictures on Scottish Song</cite>, expressed admiration
for <cite>Turnimspike</cite>, on account of its local humour, but he
did not seem to have known the author; though Motherwell, in
his edition of the works of the Ayrshire bard, supplies a few
notes concerning Graham, to whom he attributes the poem.
Stenhouse, in his illustrative notes to Johnson’s <cite>Museum</cite>, says&mdash;‘This
truly comic ballad, beginning <cite>Hersell be Highland
Shentleman</cite>, by an anonymous author, does not appear either
in the Tea-Table Miscellany, or the Orpheus Caledonius. It
is preserved, however, in Herd’s Collection of 1769....
From its excellent broad humour, and the ludicrous specimen
of a Highlander’s <em>broken</em> English, it has long been a popular
favourite in the lower districts of Scotland. It is adapted to the
ancient air of “Clout the Caldron”.’ No writer has yet ventured
to fix the date of the publication of this poem. It may, however,
be pointed out that the first General Turnpike Act for
Scotland was 7 Geo. <span class="smcap">III.</span>, c. 42 (1766&ndash;7), and it is not improbable
the passing of this Act may have been the occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of the verses which, it has been seen, obtained a place in
Herd’s Collection in 1769. They were, in all likelihood,
issued in broadside or chap-book form previous to that date.</p>

<p>The two songs already discussed, are now without quibble
regarded as the work of Dougal Graham; but there are two
others probably from his pen, which bear the mark of his
genius, were published in his time, but which have not yet
been generally regarded as his by literary antiquaries. The
first of these is <cite>Tugal M‘Tagger</cite>, unhesitatingly ascribed to
Dougal by the venerable M‘Vean. It has been suggested that
this work has traces of Alexander Rodger, on the ground that
the rhythm has a flow similar to that characteristic of
Rodger’s poems; but this reason of itself cannot be taken
as evidence in favour of the suggestion, in view of the fact
that Graham’s style was itself very uneven, and, probably on
account of carelessness, some of his pieces are as bad as others
are good. M‘Vean’s statement, also, must be allowed to go a
considerable length in a matter of this kind. The song is in
Dougal’s best vein, and may be regarded as a worthy counterpart
to <cite>Turnimspike</cite>. The following extract, by pointing to
the occasion and probable date of the composition, helps
towards the conclusion that it was the work of Graham:&mdash;‘The
Court of Session, in 1754, made an Act of Sederunt,
establishing an equality of ranking among all arrestors and
poinders within a certain period of bankruptcy. But this was
a mere experiment; and upon the expiration of the Act,
which was in force for only four years, it was not renewed.
The law fell back into its old state of imperfection; priority
gave preference, and, on the slightest alarm, creditors poured
in with diligence against the unhappy debtor, and the most
unjust preferences took place among the creditors. In this
position it continued until 1772, when the first Sequestration
Act, 12 Geo. <span class="smcap">III.</span>, c. 72, was passed. It enacted that, on a
debtor’s bankruptcy, and upon a petition to the Court of
Session by any creditor, a sequestration of his personal estate
should be awarded, which should have the effect of equalising
all arrestments and poindings used within thirty days of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
date of petition; that the estate should be vested in a factor
proposed by the creditors, and be distributed by him according
to the directions of Court; or, if it should seem more
eligible to the creditors, extrajudicially by a trustee elected
by them, as under a private trust deed. When, in 1783, this
statute came to be renewed, <em>the alarm occasioned by the novelty
of the arrangements</em> had given way to a conviction that bankruptcies
were much more beneficially administered under the
new system, imperfect as it was, than under the Common
Law.’<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Such a radical alteration on the law would afford
excellent opportunity for a popular ballad, and as there is no
good reason for doubting M‘Vean’s statement that Graham
was the author of <cite>Tugal M‘Tagger</cite>, it must in the meantime be
accepted as his production. The Act being passed in 1772,
the ballad would probably be published in the same year.
That it retained its popularity for a long time, is attested by
a note written upon it in 1869:&mdash;‘Tugal M‘Tagger was a very
popular song in Glasgow about forty years ago. It used to
be sung by Mr. Livingstone at the Theatre Royal there.’<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Even yet, it is not unknown to the people, and may be found
in some penny collections.</p>

<p>Another song, believed to be by Graham, but which has not
yet met with general approval, is an old version of <cite>Had awa
frae me, Donald</cite>. Stenhouse has indirectly suggested it as
Dougal’s work, by saying that it was probably by the same hand
that produced <cite>Turnimspike</cite>, and he mentions it as appearing in
Herd’s Collection in 1769. This song appears also in <cite>The
Blackbird</cite>, a collection of songs, ‘few of which,’ according to
the title-page, ‘are to be found in any collection,’ published in
Edinburgh in 1764. The likeness which struck Stenhouse
must also force upon every reader of the piece the same
suspicion; and without being dogmatic upon the point, the
editor of these sheets sees no reason why the version of <cite>Had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
awa frae me, Donald</cite>, given in this volume, should not be
admitted into the list of works ‘probably’ written by Graham.</p>

<p>This includes, so far as can be discovered, the metrical
works, still existing, which have been attributed to Graham.
There are others, M‘Vean mentions, but none of them appear
to have been seen since his time; and in the hope that they
may be ultimately discovered, their names, or, perhaps it may
be more proper to say, the subjects of which they treat, are
here given:&mdash;Verses on the Popular Superstitions of Scotland,
Rhythmical Dialogue between the Pope and the Prince of
Darkness, An Epitaph on the Third Command, and Verses on
the Pride of Women. As for the second of these pieces, it
may be interesting to note that a twelve-page pamphlet was
issued in 1792, bearing a similar title&mdash;<cite>Dialogue between the
Pope and Devil, on the present political state of Europe</cite>. This,
however, refers to the events immediately preceding the French
Revolution, and cannot, therefore, be looked upon as the work
of Graham. A passing reference is made by the Devil to the
beginnings of the Reform movement in Glasgow, in these
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘In Glasgow freedom sounds in every mouth;</p>
<p class="verse0">And if I could but deign to tell the truth,</p>
<p class="verse0">Not since the day I first saw Paradise,</p>
<p class="verse0">Did earth maintain such a respectful race.’</p>
</div></div>

<p>But the works upon which the fame of Dougal Graham
chiefly rests, are his chap-books. On this matter Motherwell
said that if Graham had only written the <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>,
‘we believe he never would have occupied our thoughts for a
moment; but as one who subsequently contributed largely to
the amusement of the lower classes of his countrymen, we love
to think of the facetious bellman.’<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It has already been stated
that the period during which the most of these chap-books
were written and published, was probably between 1752 and
1774, although the first editions of several are known to have
appeared subsequent to the latter date. On a subject in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
which he took so much fruitful interest, no apology is needed
for again quoting Motherwell, who says:&mdash;‘Of some of
Graham’s penny histories we had a fair assortment at one
time, principally printed by J. &amp; M. Robertson, Saltmarket,
Glasgow, which we believe might well be esteemed first
editions, but some unprincipled scoundrel has bereaved us of
that treasure. There are a number of infamous creatures, who
acquire large libraries of curious things, by borrowing books
they never mean to return, and some not unfrequently slide a
volume into their pocket, at the very moment you are fool
enough to busy yourself in showing them some nice typographic
gem, or bibliographic rarity. These dishonest and
heartless villains, ought to be cut above the breath whenever
they cross the threshold. They deserve no more courtesy
than was of old vouchsafed to witches, under bond and indenture
to the Devil.’<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Out of the ‘scanty wreck’ left him,
Motherwell was able to furnish the list given in a previous
page.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This was probably the nearest that any collector ever
attained to having a collection of first or very early editions of
Graham’s chap-books; but even in 1828 it was hardly possible
to state when the first editions were issued. It would be worse
than useless to endeavour to trace the chronological order of
their publication, or to fix definitely dates for one or all of them.
The fact seems to be that the first editions have either all disappeared,
or else bear in their title-page the vague, but not
uncommon intimation&mdash;‘Printed in this present year.’ The
danger of attempting such an arrangement may be best shown
by a statement made by the late Sheriff Strathern, a learned
local antiquary, in a paper on ‘Chapman Literature,’ delivered
before the Glasgow Archæological Society, on the 6th April,
1863. Mr. Strathern, in the course of a somewhat exhaustive
sketch, says:&mdash;‘It is difficult to give them in the order of publication;
but I have, at some little trouble, collected a few of the
editions, and, as near as I can reach it, this is the order in which
the works appeared. His earliest was “The Whole Proceedings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of Jockey and Maggy,” in five parts. It was published in 1783.... “The
Comical Sayings of Paddy from Cork” followed, and
was printed for George Caldwell, Paisley, in 1784,’ etc. Then
follows a long list of chaps by Graham, which, according to
Sheriff Strathern, were published subsequent to 1784. The
learned Sheriff may possibly have been correct in his surmise
that the works he had enumerated were published in the order
he had given them, but surely not on the understanding that
Graham’s ‘earliest’ was issued in 1783? It is not at all likely
that Graham left his works for publication after his death.
Indeed, there is positive evidence that they were in the market
long before 1783, and any edition of that date must be a reprint.
This incident of itself shows the danger of attempting
to fix dates for Dougal’s ‘penny histories,’ or even the order
of their publication, without the absolute evidence of the books
themselves, if they bear any, or the testimony of any one
who, like Mr. Caldwell, actively took part in their issue to the
public. Even Caldwell offers no information on the matter.
The only statement in this direction, upon which any reliance
can be placed, is one by Motherwell, when he states that the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">editio princeps</i> of the second part of <cite>Leper the Taylor</cite> was published
in 1779. Sheriff Strathern may have fallen into error
by trusting the date, 1787, at which Motherwell fixed Graham’s
death. That date, however, was only a surmise; and the true
date was supplied by Strang.</p>

<p>It is a matter of some interest to notice that while many of
Graham’s most popular chap-books have been issued to the
public subsequent to the period to which literature of this class
is assumed to belong, these modern editions, if they may be
so called, have for the most part been greatly mutilated.
Nearly all of them have been cut down, not apparently because
of a desire to keep out the indelicate allusions which most of
them contain&mdash;for comparatively few of these have been taken
out&mdash;but on account of the exigencies of printing. In some
cases a chap-book, originally of twenty-four or thirty-six
closely printed pages, has been compressed into twenty-five,
sixteen, or even eight pages of much larger print. The consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
is, that most of the modern editions are utterly useless
for all practical purposes, and, like most other abridgments,
the souls of their originals have been driven from them.
The truth of this remark will be indicated in the following
pages; but it will be borne out to its fullest extent by a comparison
between the early editions the editor has been able to
reprint in these volumes, and those now in circulation.</p>

<p><cite>The Whole Proceedings of Jockey and Maggy</cite>, admitted by
all authorities to have been written by Graham, may be
noticed first, as being one of his ablest and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'most charateristic'">most characteristic</ins>
works. It is written with great dramatic power, and affords
many curious insights into manners and customs about the
middle of last century. In respect of language, also, it possesses
considerable value. Professor Fraser suggests that the
first edition was in all likelihood published as early as 1755,
but, as has already been seen, it would be inadvisable to fix
any date, in the absence of either evidence or reasonable suspicion.
In the work itself there is nothing but what might
have been written at any time during the whole period of
Dougal’s life. The edition, reprinted in this collection, bears
the imprint:&mdash;‘Glasgow: Printed and Sold by J. &amp; J. Robertson.
<span class="fs70">MDCCLXXIX</span>’&mdash;and is the earliest of which any mention
has yet been made. It was thus published in the year of
Graham’s death, and as the title-page states that it was ‘Carefully
Corrected and Revised by the Author,’ it was probably
one of the latest works upon which he was engaged. While
most certainly not a first edition, it has the advantage of being,
to a certain extent, fresh from the author, and on that account
possesses a special value and interest. Motherwell’s copy
was dated 1783, and also bore to have undergone the author’s
revision. These editions both occupy thirty-six pages, and
are in five parts; but in 1793 an edition, consisting only of
three parts, was published. Since then, the three-part edition
has been the one most commonly issued to the public, and it
may still be found for sale. In 1823, however, the complete
edition was reprinted, and a few copies of it may be seen
occasionally. The abridgment, it must be noted, has seriously
marred Graham’s production. In it the first two parts are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
so far almost literal transcripts of the earlier editions, but
parts three, four, and five, are omitted, a short and very imperfect
summary of part five being inserted for part three. In
addition, an epitaph and elegy on Jockey’s mother, whose
death and burial are graphically described in the last part, are
consistently left out.</p>

<p>Of a somewhat similar character to the chap-book just
noticed is <cite>The Coalman’s Courtship of the Creelwife’s Daughter</cite>,
though it is by no means so valuable as an exhibition of manners
and superstitions. It contains, nevertheless, many interesting
references, and it gives a vigorous description of real life
among the lower classes in and around Edinburgh. Motherwell,
it has been seen, only hesitatingly ascribed this work to
Graham; but M‘Vean inserts it in his bibliography without
any reservation, though it is curious that both these writers
should make a mistake in naming it <cite>The Creelman’s Courtship</cite>.
There is no good reason to doubt that Graham was the author
of it, for the broad treatment of the subject, the animated
dialogue, and the graphic descriptions, are all in Dougal’s best
style. The edition reproduced in these volumes is the earliest
to which any reference has yet been made, having been issued
by Messrs. J. &amp; J. Robertson, from their Saltmarket press, in
1782, though it bears on the title-page to be the tenth edition
of the work. M‘Vean stated that the chap contained only two
parts, but he had fallen into a mistake, for it really consists
of three parts. The modern editions, with the exception
of a few typographical alterations, are exact reprints of the
one of 1782. Among those we have seen are two undated
editions, bearing the following imprints&mdash;‘Glasgow: Printed
for M‘Kenzie &amp; Hutchison, Booksellers, 16, Saltmarket’;
‘Edinburgh: Printed by J. Morren, Cowgate.’</p>

<p>Very different in its design from the two works already
mentioned is <cite>Lothian Tom</cite>, a narrative of the ‘comical transactions’
of a roguish fellow while sowing his wild oats.
Many of the stories told of the hero of the work are far from
being new, but they have been given a local colouring which
imparts an appearance of consistency to the book; and, incidentally,
little circumstances of life and character are brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in, giving additional value to it as illustrating the home life
of the Scottish peasantry of last century. In the chap-literature
of England and Scotland, there are many other productions
of a similar kind, in which the heroes rejoice in the
name of Tom; a circumstance that has given point to a
suggestion that the word ‘tomfoolery’ may owe its origin to
the mad pranks of the Toms of popular story. South of the
Tweed the great favourites were&mdash;<cite>Wanton Tom, or the Merry
History of Tom Stitch the Taylor</cite>; <cite>The Merry Conceits of Long
Tom the Carrier</cite>; <cite>The Mad Pranks of Tom Tram</cite>; and
another one with the euphonious title of <cite>Swalpo</cite>. All these,
like <cite>Lothian Tom</cite>, are but collections of jokes of which their
respective Toms are made the central figures. There is no
reason to believe that any of them were in the slightest degree
really biographical. The modern reprints of <cite>Lothian Tom</cite>
consist only of five parts, and in this and several minor details
they differ from the earlier editions, in which there are six
parts. Messrs. J. &amp; M. Robertson, of the Saltmarket, Glasgow,
in 1793 and 1807, published editions of the work; and
in 1816 another was issued in Edinburgh, while there are
several editions still to be found without any date. A
six-part edition, without the song to be referred to further
on, was issued by C. Randall, Stirling, in 1801. The edition
which has been used by the editor of these volumes, was
published in Edinburgh, in three numbers&mdash;including all the
six parts&mdash;the title-page of each being embellished with a
rough woodcut of a chapman full stride on the road-way.
The first number bears the imprint&mdash;‘Printed and Sold in
Niddery’s Wynd, 1775’; the second is dated 1777; while the
third has no date, though it appears to be quite as old as the
others. This, the earliest edition of which mention has yet
been made, is a most unique copy. Each number occupies
eight pages. No attention is paid to the breaking off in the
middle of a part, or even of a sentence, and the folios run
right through. A large portion of the third number is taken
up by ‘Pady’s New Catechism,’ properly belonging to another
of Graham’s chap-books, entitled, <cite>Pady from Cork</cite>, and on that
account it has been left out here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>At the close of the third number of this edition of <cite>Lothian
Tom</cite>, and reproduced in the second volume, is ‘The Plowman’s
Glory; or, Tom’s Song,’ a doggrel description of the pleasures
of country life; but it is a piece which requires more than
passing reference. The first eight lines are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘As I was a walking one morning in the spring,</p>
<p class="verse0">I heard a young plowman so sweetly to sing,</p>
<p class="verse0">And as he was singing, these words he did say,</p>
<p class="verse0">No life is like the plowman’s in the month of May.</p>
<p class="verse0">The lark in the morning rises from her nest,</p>
<p class="verse0">And mounts in the air with the dew on her breast,</p>
<p class="verse0">And with the jolly plowman she’ll whistle and she’ll sing,</p>
<p class="verse0">And at night she’ll return to her nest back again.’</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">It is interesting to notice that Cromek has attributed lines
almost identical with these to Robert Burns,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and the most
eminent editors of the works of the Ayrshire Bard have
followed him. The lines as given by Cromek read thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘As I was a wand’ring ae morning in spring,</p>

</div></div>

<p class="noindent">In a foot-note Cromek remarks&mdash;‘It is pleasing to mark those
touches of sympathy which shew the sons of genius to be of
one kindred.&mdash;In the following passage from the poem of his
countryman, the same figure is illustrated with characteristic
simplicity; and never were the tender and the sublime in
poetry more happily united, nor a more affectionate tribute
paid to the memory of Burns.</p>

<p class="noindent">It can only be inferred from the nature of this foot-note that
Cromek believed the verses to have been written by Burns,
notwithstanding the fact that he had Gilbert Burns’s statement
that his brother was not their author. The subsequent editorial
history of the lines is still more interesting. In the
Kilmarnock edition of the poet’s works, they are given with
this note:&mdash;‘Although this double stanza exists in Burns’s own
writing, his brother, Gilbert, assured Cromek that the little
song was sung by every ploughman and ploughman’s mistress
in Ayrshire, before the poet was born.’<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The Rev. Dr. P.
Hately Waddel, and the Rev. George Gilfillan, in their editions
of the works of Burns, both insert the verses without any comment.
Mr. William Scott Douglas, one of the latest and most
competent editors of Burns, has this note upon the ‘Ploughman’s
Song’:&mdash;‘Gilbert Burns expressed to Cromek a strong
doubt regarding his brother’s authorship of these lines, as also
of some other pieces found in his handwriting, and included in
the <cite>Reliques</cite> of the poet; but as the authorship of the “Bonie
Muirhen”&mdash;one of the pieces referred to&mdash;has been clearly
traced to Burns, we do not feel at liberty to reject the lines in
the text.’<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Mr. Douglas inserts the verses under the date 1780,
when Burns was twenty-two years of age; and in this connection
it is worthy of notice that another editor has put it
under the year 1794, when the poet was thirty-six years of age.</p>

<p>The obvious suggestion from what has been said is, that
Burns was not the author of the ‘Lines on a Merry Ploughman,’
which his editors, after the dogmatic statement of
Gilbert Burns, have more or less insisted upon attributing to
him; and, as a corollary, that the verses having been
found among others at the end of one of Dougal Graham’s
chap-books, as a consistent finish to the exploits of his hero,
Lothian Tom, in an edition published when Burns was a youth,
their authorship may be more clearly traced to Graham.
With a due admiration for the talents of Graham, we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
submit that the character of the verse, even as given in a
slightly polished state by Cromek, was not worthy of Burns,
who said himself that his work was all the result of careful
revisal. Graham’s verses often display false quantity; his
rhyme is often far from true; and his grammar is frequently
lame: but these are faults which the greatest detractor of the
genius of Robert Burns would find it difficult to lay to his
charge. It might be urged, of course, that this may have been
a youthful production of Burns’s pen; but it is more probable,
from his known habit of noting down any remnant of song he
found among the people, that he wrote out what he
had heard sung from his infancy. In support of this idea,
there is Gilbert Burns’s assurance ‘that the little song was sung
by every ploughman and ploughman’s mistress in Ayrshire
before the poet was born.’ To us it seems conclusive that
Burns was not its author, and that, from its position in an
early&mdash;not by any means the first&mdash;edition of one of Graham’s
most popular chap-books, to Graham must be attributed its
composition, with all the praise or blame that may attach to it.</p>

<p><cite>The History of John Cheap the Chapman</cite> belongs to the
same class of chap-books as <cite>Lothian Tom</cite>, though it has been
usual to believe that, unlike the latter, it was to a certain
extent autobiographical, and that in it Graham related some
of his own experiences. It has been already seen that its
value in this respect, if it has any, cannot be estimated on
account of the doubt as to whether it is autobiography or
fiction. There can be no question, however, that it contains a
most valuable account of the real life of the Scottish Chapman,
with many vivid glimpses of home life in Scotland in the
middle of last century. Like all the others, its indelicacy is
sometimes notorious, but like them its truthfulness must be its
apology. The earliest dated edition we have seen is one
published in 1798 by Johnston of Falkirk; but another, in some
slight details more complete, was issued by J. Morren, of the
Cowgate, Edinburgh, about the beginning of this, or the closing
year of the eighteenth, century. The modern editions are
almost identical with the ones mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The plan of another of Graham’s chap-books, <cite>Fun upon
Fun, or the Comical Tricks of Leper the Taylor</cite>, is very similar
to that which has been pointed out as characteristic of <cite>Lothian
Tom</cite> and <cite>John Cheap</cite>. Leper is a madcap whose impudent
doings bear a strong resemblance to stories told of similar
beings in this and other countries; and the design of the author
seems to have been to lay before his readers a collection of tales
grouped round one central figure, rather than to give a record
of the life of any real person. This, however, has been done
so skilfully&mdash;by local colouring, and the introduction of little
incidents which must have had their counterparts in the
every-day life of the people&mdash;that the work has always
been most deservedly popular. In point of time, this seems
to have been one of the latest, if not the latest, of Graham’s
publications, for Motherwell was able to give the title and
date of what he believed to be the first edition of the
second part as follows:&mdash;‘Fun upon Fun; or the Comical
Tricks of Leper the Taylor. Part II. Glasgow: Printed for
the Company of Flying Stationers in Town and Country.
1779.’ As the work is in two parts, it is probable that the
first would be published a short time before the date mentioned.
Motherwell also records that there was this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nota bene</i>
to the second part&mdash;‘The Third Part will contain a variety
of his Witty Tricks in the different periods of his Life.’ It is
a question whether Graham was ever able to fulfil his promise;
for his death occurred, as has been seen, in the July of
the year in which the second part was issued. The fact that,
in later editions of <cite>Leper the Taylor</cite>, there is added to the two
original parts one giving an account of <cite>The Grand Solemnity
of the Taylor’s Funeral</cite>, quite in the same style, and a consistent
conclusion to the life of the Sartorian worthy, affords
reasonable presumption that he did so, and without any hesitation
the third part has, like the others, been accepted as the
work of Graham. This chap-book is in many respects akin to
several booklets which found a place in the popular literature of
England; but possibly its counterpart may be found in <cite>Joaks
upon Joaks, or No Joak like a True Joak, being the Diverting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Humours of Mr. John Ogle, a Life Guard Man</cite>. As for the
modern editions, they differ in many respects from the early
ones, though not materially, except that they leave out the
third part. The earliest dated edition that we have seen was
printed by C. Randall, Stirling, in 1799. It is without the
third part, and is of sixteen pages. The next was ‘Printed
in the year 1816’; but the title-page does not state the
town of publication. It contains all the three parts, and
occupies twenty-four pages duodecimo. Another edition,
almost identical with the one mentioned, was ‘Printed in the
year 1820,’ and in this case also the town of issue is not
stated. In what appears to be a chap-book of English manufacture,
without date or place of publication, there is appended
the <cite>Grand Solemnity of the Taylor’s Funeral</cite>, on which some
slight alterations have been made, notably in the way of
Anglicising the names of the characters. On the title-page
of the work mentioned is a rough woodcut, representing the
lowering of a body into the grave, while in the back-ground
stands a primitive-looking hearse, drawn by two horses.</p>

<p>The two chap-books that now fall to be spoken of are very
different in their nature from any to which reference has yet
been made, and, indeed, they may be said to form a class by
themselves, for they are unique in the popular literature of
either Scotland or England. <cite>The History of Haverel Wives</cite>,
‘written,’ as the title-page states, ‘by Humphrey Clinker, the
Clashing Wives’ Clerk,’ one of the many cognomens adopted
by Graham, is a ‘comical’ and exceedingly interesting conference
between two old women, on their experiences of the past.
The object of the author seems to have been to bring together
in small compass as much folk-lore as possible, and this he
prefaces by the remark, that he had ‘furnished the public with
a small collection of old wives’ noted sayings and wonders,
which, they relate, happened in their own time; also, what has
been told them by their forefathers.’ The intention is thus
shown to have been to hold the old wives up to a little gentle
satire, though this generation must regard the result as being
a most valuable contribution to the antiquities of Scotland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
The language used is frequently very old, and ancient superstitions
and beliefs are given expression to in the words of
those who more or less put faith in them. This chap-book,
also, must be esteemed because of the descriptions given in it
of the doings of an age long before the period usually dealt
with by works of a similar nature&mdash;an age, the great events
of which have been duly recorded by historians who have
paid but little attention to the lives of the peasantry, or to
the motives of their actions. It would not be too much to say
that not within the whole range of Scottish literature could a
more graphic account be obtained of the manner of observing
the first day of the week in Scotland in pre-reformation and
prelatic times, than is to be found in this unconsidered booklet
The second chap-book of this class is <cite>Janet Clinker’s Oration on
the Virtues of the Old Women, and the Pride of the Young</cite>. It
is put forward as having been dictated by Janet Clinker, one
of the <cite>Haverel Wives</cite>, to ‘Humphrey Clinker,’ and it consists
of a comparison between the women of her young days and
those of the days in which she then lived. The whole tone
of the work is satirical, and the young women are made to
undergo a severe reprimand for their proud and upsetting
behaviour. These chap-books were frequently printed together,
though a 1781 edition of the <cite>Haverel Wives</cite> concludes
with the simple intimation&mdash;‘Humphrey’s Aunt Janet is yet
alive, and has made an oration in praise of the old women,
and on the pride of the young.’ Another edition, undated,
published by Morren of Edinburgh, is also without Janet’s
<cite>Oration</cite>, but it concludes by stating that the two old women
went and ‘birl’d their bawbees,’ and made an agreement</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘Never to drink ae drop of tea,</p>
<p class="verse0">But stout brown ale and whisky bare’&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">a conclusion quite different from what is given in the edition
of 1781, for in it Maggy, Janet’s gossip, dies ‘keeping her
purse in her hand.’ An edition was published in Glasgow, in
1807, by J. &amp; J. Robertson. This is the first in which we
have seen the two chap-books printed together, and it is also
the earliest copy of <cite>Janet Clinker’s Oration</cite> that has come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
under our notice. The <cite>Haverel Wives</cite>, in this case, is reprinted
from the 1781 edition, and only in one or two slight matters,
apparently typographical, differs from it. The <cite>Oration</cite> was
printed alone in 1824, with the title&mdash;‘Grannie M‘Nab’s
Lecture in the Society of Clashing Wives, Glasgow, on Witless
Mothers and their Dandy Daughters, who bring them up
to hood-wink the men, and deceive them with their braw
dresses, when they can neither wash a sark, mak’ parritch, or
gang to the well. Printed for the Booksellers.’ A chap-book
bearing the title of <cite>The Art of Courtship</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> an Undated edition
of which was published by M. Randall, of Stirling, contains
matter somewhat similar to much that is contained in <cite>Janet
Clinker’s Oration</cite>, and the part that relates to the choosing of
a wife is quoted almost <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">verbatim et literatim</i>. It is somewhat
remarkable that no editions of these works were, so far as we
have been able to discover, issued subsequent to 1824.</p>

<p><cite>The Comical and Witty Jokes of John Falkirk, the Merry
Piper</cite>, one of the least known of Graham’s chap-books, is, as
its name indicates, merely a collection of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facetiæ</i>. Many of
the tales in it are cleverly told, while a few have nothing to
recommend them to the reader. Motherwell, on the authority
of Caldwell, attributes the work to Graham, and all other
writers on the subject have concurred with him. We have
only seen one edition of <cite>John Falkirk</cite>, and it was published
in Edinburgh in 1777; but Motherwell notes one issued in
Glasgow two years later. No modern edition of it has been
published. The <cite>Scots Piper’s Queries, or John Falkirk’s
Cariches</cite>, is regarded as a sequel to the <cite>Jokes</cite> of the same
worthy. The <cite>Cariches</cite> are well known, and have long been
popular, though it cannot be said there is anything particularly
original about them. Many of the jokes in them were
venerable in Graham’s time, but he has touched them up to
suit the tastes of the age in which he wrote. Not a few of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the questions and answers have a distinct flavour of the
proverbs of Solomon; and while the expressions used are
sometimes far from delicate, a good deal of worldly wisdom is
to be found in them. The intention of the author, however,
seems to have been amusement purely and simply, for in the
title-page of an undated edition, published by C. Randall, of
Stirling, there are these lines, which, it may be assumed
belong to the original work:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘’Twill please the bairns and keep them laughing,</p>
<p class="verse0">And mind the goodwife o’ her daffing.’</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">‘John Falkirk,’ it has already been mentioned, was a cognomen
used by Graham; and Motherwell has noted that, in an
edition of the <cite>Cariches</cite> published after Graham’s death, there
was prefixed an ‘Account of John Falkirk, the Scots Piper.’
The only early edition we have seen is one printed by C.
Randall, Stirling. It is undated, but was probably printed
about 1807, and consists of eight pages. So far as it goes it
does not materially differ from the modern editions, but it is
without forty questions and answers which appear in them.
It is probable that, out of the general rule, the modern editions
are more complete than the one published by Randall. On
the title-page of the Stirling chap-book is a rough wood-cut
of a blind beggar led by a dog, presumably designed as a
frontispiece for an English chap, entitled, ‘The Blind Beggar
of Bethnal Green,’ very popular south of the Tweed, and
occasionally printed in Scotland. Motherwell’s edition of
<cite>John Falkirk</cite> was published in Glasgow in 1779, but his copy
of the <cite>Cariches</cite> was undated.</p>

<p>The <cite>Comical Sayings of Pady from Cork</cite> is the title of a
chap-book attributed to Graham by Motherwell and all his
successors. Unlike the bellman’s other works it does not
deal with any phase of Scottish life, but rather with the
vagaries popularly believed for many generations to be characteristic
of the Irish mind. It is, in fact, a collection of the
proverbial Irish ‘bulls,’ some of them ‘comical’ and spontaneous,
but others studied and consequently stupid. In
many respects the dialogue between Pady and his English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
interlocutor, Tom, is clever, but frequently it is evident that
the author was out of his element. It must be confessed that
there is a good deal of force in Professor Fraser’s argument,
so far as <cite>Pady from Cork</cite> is concerned, that there was not a
single sentence in it which might not have been written by
any one other than Graham, and that most of the incidents
narrated in it were to be found in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facetiæ</i> of almost every
country in Europe long before Graham carried a pack or rang
the skellat bell of Glasgow.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Mr. Fraser refers in these
remarks in the first instance to <cite>George Buchanan</cite> and <cite>The
History of Buckhaven</cite>, but he applies them to <cite>Pady from Cork</cite>,
with the modification that it was less of a compilation and
had more local colouring than the chap-books he had been
discussing. But while all that may be true enough, Motherwell’s
authority in attributing the authorship of <cite>Pady from
Cork</cite> to Dougal Graham cannot well be impugned, for on this
point he apparently writes under the inspiration of his friend
Mr. Caldwell; and it is notable that the copy in the possession
of Motherwell was published by Caldwell in 1784. The
edition reprinted from in this collection was published in
Glasgow by J. &amp; M. Robertson in 1807, and on the title-page
there is a wood-cut showing a military looking gentleman
standing beside a small cannon. The modern editions are
considerably mutilated, and, among other things, want the
‘Creed for Romish Believers,’ to be found in earlier copies.
‘Pady’s New Catechism’ and his ‘Creed’ have been mentioned
in a preceding page as being in the third number
of a very rare edition of <cite>Lothian Tom</cite>, to all appearance only
as padding.</p>

<p>Motherwell and M‘Vean both attributed the authorship of
<cite>Simple John and his Twelve Misfortunes</cite> to Dougal Graham;
but Professor Fraser, on the other hand, has brought a distinct
charge of plagiarism against the poetical bellman. ‘The
original hero of the “Misfortunes,”’ he says, ‘is <cite>Simple Simon</cite>;
a history of whose life and misadventures was common in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
England in the seventeenth century. This, or a similar
version&mdash;most likely one of the many editions issued from
Newcastle&mdash;Graham most certainly stole, and, having changed
the hero’s name to <em>John</em>, and written a racy introduction to the
work in broad Scotch, gave it to the world as an original production.
The prefatory matter is quite in Graham’s style, and
could not have been written by an Englishman. It is frequently
to be found published separately under the title of
<cite>Silly Tam</cite>.’<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> But before going into the question here raised,
it may be as well to state that the edition from which <cite>Simple
John</cite> has been reprinted in this collection, is one published in
Glasgow in 1780, and ‘Printed for the Company of Flying
Stationers in Town and Country.’ The original is a duodecimo,
and consists of eight closely printed pages, with a wood-cut on
the title-page, representing the unfortunate husband running
from his wife, who pursues him with outstretched arms, while
his haste is emphasised by his hat and wig being shown as
falling from his head to the ground. The other editions
now lying before the editor are&mdash;1st, one printed in Edinburgh,
in 1821, ‘for the booksellers,’ of twenty-four pages
duodecimo; and another almost identical in every way, the
print being nearly line for line the same, bearing the imprint&mdash;‘Edinburgh:
Printed for the Booksellers, 1823.’ Both these
editions have, as a frontispiece, the picture of a hook-nosed
termagant, giving a simple looking fellow, with a beer-mug
in his hand, a severe shaking. The matter in the modern
undated edition, ‘printed for the booksellers’ in Glasgow, is
the same, with one or two slight differences, as what is to be
found in the older ones already enumerated. But, in addition to
these, there also lies before us a copy of <cite>The Miseries of Poor
Simple Innocent Tam</cite>, which, like one mentioned by Professor
Fraser, is of eight pages duodecimo, without covers, and
gives no indication of date or place of issue. With the
exception of the alteration of the name of the hero from ‘John’
to ‘Tam,’ the text is exactly the same as that contained in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
introduction to <cite>Simple John</cite>. An undated edition, of eight
pages, of <cite>Simple John</cite> was printed by William Cameron, in
Edinburgh. It only contains the introductory matter, and
concludes with the addition of John’s lament on the death of
his mother, without making further reference to his misfortunes.
Having thus detailed the several editions of what has generally
been regarded as Graham’s chap-book, in its two-fold form of
<cite>Simple John</cite> and <cite>Simple Tam</cite>, some attention may now be paid
to Professor Fraser’s allegations against the literary morality of
the reputed author. After a careful comparison of the English
chap-book, <cite>Simple Simon</cite>, with <cite>Simple John</cite>, we cannot but
admit the statement that ‘the prefatory matter is quite in
Graham’s style, and could not have been written by an Englishman;’
but we are not prepared to admit that Graham ‘most
certainly stole’ the main body of the work. What Professor
Fraser assumes to have been stolen must have been, though
he does not explicitly say so, the ‘Twelve Misfortunes,’ for he
admits that the preface is original and Scotch. This conclusion
seems to have been come to without careful collation.
Any one who has the opportunity, and will take the trouble
to collate the two works, will find that only in two instances
do the misfortunes in the Scotch chap-book bear any resemblance
to those described in its English counterpart. These
two instances are the fourth and seventh misfortunes in
<cite>Simple John</cite>; but though the general features are the same,
there is a great difference in the mode of treatment. As for
the other misfortunes that befell <cite>Simple John</cite>, they have not
even counterparts in <cite>Simple Simon</cite>, and, indeed, they could
not well have, for they are almost entirely Scotch in their
nature. Again, the conclusions arrived at in the two books
are different. <em>Simple Simon</em> endeavours to poison himself,
but by mistake he takes a draught from his wife’s bottle of
sack, becomes drunk, and is cudgelled in consequence, but he
and his wife afterwards lead a happy life. No such good
fortune attends <em>Simple John</em>, for he laments his unhappy fate,
and ‘appeals to a Jedburgh jury, if it be not easier to deal wi’
fools than headstrong, fashious fouks; owns he has but an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
empty scull, but his wicked wife wants wit to pour judgment
into it, never tells him o’ danger till it comes upon him, for
his mither said he was a bidable bairn, if onybody had been
to learn him wit.’ We cannot, therefore, concur in Mr.
Fraser’s statement that Graham ‘stole’ this chap-book, ‘and
gave it to the world as an original production.’ For the
reasons shown, we believe Graham only took the idea&mdash;and it
may be gravely questioned if he did so much, for it has yet
to be proved that <cite>Simple Simon</cite> was ‘common in England in
the seventeenth century,’<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>&mdash;from the English chap-book, and
worked it out in a manner peculiarly his own, and, it must
also be added, distinctively Scotch.</p>

<p>In the case of another chap-book usually believed to owe
its existence to Dougal Graham, Professor Fraser has seen fit
to go against the general verdict, without, as it seems to us,
giving a sufficient reason for the position he has taken up.
He considers it extremely improbable, judging from internal
evidence, that Graham ever composed the <cite>History of Buckhaven</cite>;
and, further on, referring to it and <cite>The Witty Exploits
of George Buchanan</cite>, he says, ‘There is not a single sentence
in either of them that might not have been written by any
one else.’ The latter remark may be all very true, but the
former one must involve a serious difference of opinion. It
would indeed be difficult to say what internal evidence is to
be found in the <cite>History of Buckhaven</cite> that gave good reason
for the assumption that Graham was not its author. Motherwell,
judging apparently on this ‘internal evidence,’ says that,
although he had not authority for ascribing any popular
chap-books to Graham other than those he had mentioned, he
would not be surprised to find that Graham was also the author
of this history. M‘Vean, without comment, gives the work a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
place in his bibliography of Graham’s works, and it is to be
presumed that a man of his undoubted attainments as a
literary antiquary would not have done so without some
reason satisfactory at least to himself. For our own part, we
see nothing in the work itself at all inconsistent with the idea
that Graham may have been the author of it. On the contrary,
there seem to be some points in the course of the
narrative which strongly support the commonly accepted
tradition. That Graham possessed an undoubted acquaintance
with the western district of Fifeshire, in which the
respectable town of Buckhaven is situated, is evident from
<cite>Jockey and Maggy’s Courtship</cite>, the scene of which is laid in
the vicinity of Torryburn; and his intimate knowledge of
Fifeshire modes of speech is further shown by an amusing
character he introduced into <cite>The Coalman’s Courtship</cite>&mdash;‘auld
Mattie, the Fife wife ... the wife it says, <em>Be-go laddie</em>.’
The language used in the <cite>History of Buckhaven</cite>, the style of
treatment, and the burlesque humour, all bespeak Dougal as
its author, for they are similar in all important points to
what are to be found in works which even Mr. Fraser has
without hesitation assented to being ascribed to Graham.
The history, of course, is a burlesque, after the style of a well-known
English chap-book, <cite>The Wise Men of Gotham</cite>, which
it far outstrips for cleverness and racy humour. It has,
however, the taint common to so many of Dougal’s works.
The whole motive may be summed up in a short quotation
from one of the many defunct Glasgow magazines:&mdash;‘The
Buckhaven people, originally foreign colonists, were a people
on the Fife side of the Forth, who lived much by themselves,
had singular manners, and were of uncouth speech. All kinds
of absurdities could thus be safely palmed upon them.’<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Messrs.
J. &amp; M. Robertson, Saltmarket, issued a 24 pp. edition of
the <cite>History of Buckhaven</cite> in 1806, illustrated by some very
rude woodcuts, most of them having done duty in other chap-books.
This edition is in three parts; and the title-page bears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that the work was written by ‘Merry Andrew at Tamtallon.’
The more modern issues only contain the first two parts, and
even these are considerably abridged.</p>

<p>The last work attributed to Dougal Graham, and calling
for any detailed notice in this place, is the one entitled <cite>The
History and Entertaining Exploits of George Buchanan, who
was commonly called the King’s Fool</cite>. It is a chap-book which
has been long popular, and one which has given rise to a
variety of speculations, not only as to its authorship but also
as to who was really the person whose ‘exploits’ are professedly
recorded in its pages. As to the first of these points,
Motherwell said he would not be surprised if Graham were
its author; and M‘Vean heads his list of Dougal’s works
with it. Fraser, on the other hand, argues against it being
the composition of Graham, the ground he takes up being
the same as that already quoted in relation to <cite>The History of
Buckhaven</cite> and <cite>Simple John</cite>. In this instance, however, we
think he has a stronger case than he had against Graham’s
authorship of the two other publications. The internal
evidence of the work itself&mdash;the time at which George
Buchanan is shown to have lived&mdash;is sufficient proof that in it
Graham could not in any sense lay claim to originality. But
at the same time it is more than probable that he brought
together the stories told about the country regarding his
hero, and for the first time <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'gave then forth'">gave them forth</ins> to the world in
a collected form. Until some additional light can be shed
upon this matter, dogmatism either on the one side or the
other would be imprudent; but, while sympathising to some
extent with the position taken up by Professor Fraser, we
do not see our way clear to dissent from the tradition of
Graham’s connection with the chap-book. The idea that he
may have been its editor, or compiler, appears to be quite
reasonable.</p>

<p>The next question, as to the identity of the hero of <cite>The
Merry Exploits of George Buchanan</cite>, is one upon which a
more definite opinion can be expressed, though it has given
rise to several curious notions. The idea most common at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the present day among the mass of the Scottish people is
that there were two Scotsmen who bore the name of George
Buchanan, one of them being the King’s fool, and the other
the eminent Latinist, historian, and poet. This theory, it
must be confessed, is the one which does the most credit to
the scholar, but we are afraid it does not do justice to the
fact. There can be no doubt, from many of the stories given
in the chap-book, that George Buchanan, the scholar, is the
person pointed at; and a careful consideration of his life and
opinions, viewed in the light in which these were regarded
by many of his contemporaries and immediate successors,
will readily furnish the origin of the extraordinary actions
attributed to him. We must not, however, be understood to
give countenance to another impression, by no means uncommon
among a certain class, that George Buchanan acted
as the King’s buffoon or fool. The life of the historian of
Scotland was cast in a troublous age. Born in the year 1506,
he was an active participant in the turmoil of the Reformation
period, and had a large share in the proceedings against the
unfortunate Queen Mary. Like most of the reformers his
nature was stiff and unbending, but he possessed a dry
and caustic wit which made him valuable to his friends
and more and more hated by his enemies. His opponents
took every opportunity to vilify his character, and spread
abroad by means of books and conversations, after his
death, even by Acts of the Scottish Estates, aspersions on
his life and opinions. To show how this was done, one
or two instances may be given. A French priest named
Garasse, in a work entitled <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Doctrine Curieuse</cite>,&mdash;an edition
of which was published in 1590, a few years after Buchanan’s
death&mdash;speaks of that illustrious man as a ‘hard drinker.’
After endeavouring to show how his whole life had been one
of continual debauchery, Garasse proceeds with his shameless
libel, and makes Buchanan say on his death-bed, in answer to
the remonstrances of his doctors:&mdash;‘“Go along with you, you
and your prescriptions and dietaries! I would far rather live
only three jolly weeks, getting comfortably drunk every day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
than live six dreary <em>wineless</em> years.” ... He died in brief
space, however; his chamber being then rarely littered with
glasses and wine-measures.’ In his native country, also, his
memory was abused. His death in 1582 was little noticed,
but it was soon followed by an outburst against his writings.
His works have long been regarded as valuable in spite of
the many defects they admittedly have; but the Scottish
Estates, in 1584, issued an order for their purgation because
they contained ‘sundrie offensive matters, worthie to be
detecte,’ because of their ‘steiring up his hienes subjectes
theirby to misliking sedition unquietness, and to cast off their
due obedience to his Majestie.’ Heylin, in his <cite>Cosmographie</cite>,
said Buchanan’s <cite>History of Scotland</cite> and <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Jure Regni</cite> had
‘wrought more mischief in the world than all Machiavel’s
works’; and the authorities of the University of Oxford, in
1683, publicly burned the political works of George Buchanan,
along with others equally obnoxious to them. These few
incidents, among many, are sufficient to indicate how the
extraordinary stories told in the chap-book came to be
attached to George Buchanan, one of the most learned and
cultured men of his time. There is good ground for the remark
that the <cite>Merry Exploits of George Buchanan</cite> ‘is a terrible libel
on an eminent man; never was mental greatness so “let
down” in the popular estimation as by this vulgar performance;
by and through which Buchanan’s humble countrymen
were taught, not to look up to him, but down upon him as a
coarse buffoon.’<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> It must be admitted, however, that there
is strong reason to suspect that many of the stories were current
before the issue of the chap-book, but it, of course, would help
to perpetuate the libels. The conclusion from what has been
said may be thus briefly summarised. Dougal Graham seems
to have been the collector of ridiculous stories about George
Buchanan, the scholar and historian, these stories being, for
the most part, manifestly untrue, but the natural offspring of
the more elaborate libels written and spoken against him
immediately after his death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Many editions of this chap-book have been published, and
it promises to have the longest life of any of its race, for it is
still being issued. The copy reprinted in this work was
published in Falkirk in 1799. Among the other editions
we have seen are the following:&mdash;One issued in Edinburgh
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'bear-to be ‘printed'">bears ‘to be printed</ins> in this present year,’ a somewhat indefinite
intimation, consisting of 47 <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'duodesimo pages'">duodecimo pages</ins>; and one
in two numbers of 24 pp. each, printed in Newcastle by
G. Angus, without date, and apparently complete. The
earliest edition mentioned is one published by A. Robertson,
Coalhill, Leith, in 1765. It was an octavo, in six parts of
eight pages each, with a title-page to each part. Another
was printed by W. R. Walker, Royal Arcade, Newcastle-on-Tyne,
but it bears no date. The Robertsons, of the
Saltmarket, Glasgow, also issued several editions of this
chap-book, among the rest of their ‘Standards.’</p>

<p>Having thus gone over, with as much detail as possible, the
various works attributed to Dougal Graham, it will be proper
to give the list of them, with the dates of the editions
reprinted in these volumes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">There are probably others of which even the names have been
lost; but it seems likely that very few, if any, of those classified
as not found, will ever be traced. It is a pity that this
should be so; and every lover of the literary antiquities of
Scotland must fondly hope that in the course of time, by
some happy accident, the lost chap-books of Dougal Graham
may again see the light of day.</p>

<p>By way of conclusion, it will be appropriate to discuss the
general character of these works. Such an inquiry involves
the weighing of opinions of several writers who, it must be
admitted on all hands, were in every way qualified to give a
judgment in the matter.</p>

<p>The leading opinion must, of course, be that of Sir Walter
Scott. This is the record Strang<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> gives of it:&mdash;‘A history of
the vulgar literature of Scotland has been long and is unquestionably
still a desideratum, for certainly nothing could
tend to throw so much light on the manners and tastes of the
great body of the people as such a work. In 1830 it was
hoped that Sir Walter Scott&mdash;than whom no man could have
so well and so heartily performed the task&mdash;would have undertaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
it as a preface to Dougal Graham’s History of the
Rebellion, which, as we have hinted, he proposed giving to
the Maitland Club, but unfortunately he abandoned the idea;
yet, in doing so, Sir Walter, in a letter dated 10th May, 1830,
to the writer of this volume, among other things of Dougal,
said&mdash;“Neither had I the least idea of his being the author of
so much of our Bibliotheque Bleue as you ascribe to him,
embracing unquestionably several coarse but excessively
meritorious pieces of popular humour. The <cite>Turnamspike</cite>
alone was sufficient to entitle him to immortality. I had, in
my early life, a great collection of these chap-books, and had
six volumes of them bought before I was ten years old, comprehending
most of the more rare and curious of our popular
tracts.”’</p>

<p>Motherwell, again, says that he himself projected&mdash;but
was unable, through want of leisure, and the difficulty of
obtaining materials, to carry his intention into effect&mdash;a
history of vulgar literature, in which, as a matter of course,
Graham must have occupied a prominent place. Referring to
the <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>, he says:&mdash;‘However slightingly
we esteem his metrical powers, we really believe he has conscientiously
and honestly detailed the events which came
under his observation. It is not, however, on the merits of
this work, that Graham’s fame rests. Had he only written it,
we believe he never would have occupied our thoughts for a
moment; but as one who subsequently contributed largely to
the amusement of the lower classes of his countrymen, we love
to think of the facetious bellman. To his rich vein of gross
comic humour, laughable and vulgar description, great shrewdness
of observation, and strong, though immeasurably coarse
sense, every one of us, after getting out of toy books and fairy
tales, has owed much. In truth, it is no exaggeration when we
state, that he who desires to acquire a thorough knowledge of
low Scottish life, vulgar manners, national characteristics, and
popular jokes, must devote his days and nights to the study
of John Cheap the Chapman&mdash;Leper the Taylor&mdash;Paddy from
Cork&mdash;The whole proceedings of Jockie and Maggie’s Courtship&mdash;Janet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Clinker’s Orations&mdash;Simple John, &amp;c., all productions
of Dougald’s fertile brain, and his unwearied application
to the cultivation of vulgar literature. To refined taste
Dougald had no pretensions. His indelicacy is notorious&mdash;his
coarseness an abomination&mdash;but they are characteristic of the
class for whom he wrote. He is thoroughly imbued with the
national humours and peculiarities of his countrymen of the
humblest classes, and his pictures of their manners, modes of
thinking and conversation, are always sketched with a strong
and faithful pencil. Indeed, the uncommon popularity the chap-books
above noted have acquired, entitles them, in many a point
of view, to the regard of the moralist, and the literary historian.
We meet with them on every stall, and in every cottage.
They are essentially the Library of Entertaining Knowledge
to our peasantry, and have maintained their ground in the
affections of the people, notwithstanding the attempt of
religious, political, or learned associations, to displace them, by
substituting more elegant and wholesome literature in their
stead.’<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Strang’s judgment is similar:&mdash;‘Of the vulgar literature
to which we have referred, and of so much of which Dougal
Graham was the author, it is enough to say that it really contributed
the chief literary pabulum enjoyed by the bulk of our
countrymen in the humbler walks of life; and though the
jokes therein promulgated certainly were broad, and sometimes
even grossly indecent, they were not untrue portraitures of
Scottish life and Scottish manners.’<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Professor Fraser thus discusses the same matter:&mdash;‘He
[Graham] possessed this advantage over the ordinary historian;
that the latter from his superior height and position seldom
condescended to enter the huts of the poor, and when he did
enter, the inmates were frightened into their “Sunday clothes
and manners” by his stately and majestic presence. But
Dougal, being himself one of the poorest, introduces us into
the most secret, domestic, and every-day life and thoughts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the lower classes of last century. Nothing is hidden from him.
He is treated with a familiarity which shows that his hosts
have no wish to hide anything. Then, too, he made his reader
familiar not only with their mode of life, but with the peculiarities
of their dialect, and in this way shed a not unfrequent
light on philology. Add to these virtues that Dougal is
never out of humour, always laughing and gossiping, drinking
and telling old tales. His laughter, also, is contagious; we
cannot contain ourselves. All his stories are full of people
who laugh “like to burst,” and one cannot help but join them
in their cacchinations. Nor are his sketches wanting in dramatic
power. The characters are full of individuality and life,
rendered more significant by a local flavour of demeanor and
dialect. More than one of them might have afforded models
for some of the raciest of Scott’s creations, and all of them are
instinct with genuine humour and vitality.’<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Such were the opinions regarding the writings of Dougal
Graham, given expression to by four men who had studied
them, and saw their value. It is difficult, and almost unnecessary,
to add anything further to what they have said;
but in bringing this account of Graham’s works to a close, we
may be permitted to supplement the judgments quoted, by a
few additional speculations.</p>

<p>Much has been said about the value these writings possess,
because they are, for the most part, truthful descriptions of the
life of the Scottish people of last century. In what other
works, or series of works&mdash;even those professedly dealing with
the subject&mdash;can there be obtained such a knowledge of how
the common people lived a century or two ago? We venture
to affirm that such cannot be found. The life of the people is
the life of the nation; and if it be a virtue to write personal
biography like Boswell, it is surely more so to record the inner
life of a nation, like Graham. Both, differing widely in many
and important respects, have attained success by the same
means&mdash;by placing before their readers sketches of private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
life, of the life which is most natural and least artificial, and
which gives the best notion of the feelings and motives that
guided either individuals or nations to success or failure. To
understand thoroughly the history of Scotland in the eighteenth
century, the ordinary historical works, dealing principally
with great movements and events, must be read in the light,
and by the aid, of the popular literature of that period;
in the same way as the resident of the twentieth century,
desiring to know the true history of the present age must,
while looking to its great religious, philanthropic, scientific,
commercial, political, and military achievements, also take
into account the criminal records, the proceedings of the
courts, the annals of the poor, and the ephemeral literature of
all kinds.</p>

<p>Another line of thought is suggested by the indelicacy of
expression so frequently to be found in Graham’s works.
That such indelicacy exists in his works must be admitted; but
in this respect they are no worse than, and will compare favourably
with, the writings of many of the most prominent Scottish
authors, such as Sir David Lindsay, and others. Indeed, it
is worthy of notice, that men such as Fielding, Sterne, Swift,
and Smollet, highly educated, and moving in a better circle of
society in the same age with Dougal Graham, have tainted
their writings with the grossness which has been noticed,
and which, in their case, is less easily excused. The fault
was in the time when plain speaking took the place now
occupied by inuendo. Notwithstanding this, it cannot but be
noticed that in his writings there is a native manliness not
often discovered in works having greater pretensions; that
there is no mawkish sentiment or sickly prudishness; and that
in the presentation of pictures of life, they have no artificial
draperies more suggestive than nature itself. There is a
tendency on the part of those who have written upon this subject,
to deplore the indelicacy of many passages of Graham’s
works. We do not feel ourselves under any obligation to do
so, for had the author toned down the colouring of some of
his chap-books, they would have been untrue to nature to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
extent of the suppression. What should be regretted was the
immorality and coarseness so prevalent among the lower
classes in Scotland during last century; and he who wishes to
further the improvement and condition of the people will welcome
Graham’s chap-books as showing distinctly what required
reformation a century ago. It would hardly be too much to
say, that in some parts of Scotland a state of matters very
little different from what Graham frequently describes, may
still be found. Any one who is at all acquainted with life
among the lower classes, must admit that these descriptions
are true to nature, and that a study of them is necessary
before we can know thoroughly upon what the present superstructure
of Scottish civilisation has been built. Graham,
perhaps unintentionally, has held ‘the mirror up to nature,’
has shown ‘virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and
the very age and body of the time his form and pressure.’</p>

<p>It would be difficult, again, to over-estimate the value of
Dougal Graham’s works as affording illustrations of the folk-lore
of Scotland. Almost all the superstitions that obtained
among the common people of his time he has touched upon
either directly or indirectly; and in many instances he has
given information upon this and kindred subjects which it
would be difficult to find anywhere else. While all his chap-books
may be found useful in this direction, a few of them
stand out as perfect storehouses of folk-lore. Among the
most notable of these are <cite>The History of Buckhaven</cite>, <cite>The History
of the Haveral Wives</cite>, <cite>Jockey and Maggy’s Courtship</cite>, the
three parts of <cite>Leper the Taylor</cite>, and even <cite>Pady from Cork</cite>.
In the first-mentioned chap-book there are some particularly
valuable notes about the opinions current regarding the Arch-enemy
and all his supposed representatives on earth, such as
witches, kelpies, fairies, and ‘bogles’ of all kinds. The folk-lore
of the hare, or ‘mauken,’ in this work is also very full,
and has given Mr. William George Black, F.S.A., Scot., a
valuable illustration for his able article on ‘The Hare in Folk-Lore,’
in a recent issue of <cite>The Folk-Lore Journal</cite>. Similar
remarks could be made about the other chap-books specially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
named, but enough has been said in a general way to indicate
their value in this direction. In the notes to the chap-books
themselves some attempt may be made to show, in a manner
more detailed than is possible here, their worth as throwing
light upon the superstitions prevalent during the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>How far the genius of Dougal Graham would have been
affected by an education superior to that which he obtained,
it would be difficult to say. Possibly greater culture might
have raised him to the rank of a Scott; perhaps it might only
have left him in the ranks of mediocrity. In the one case he
would have produced works of greater literary value; in the
other, possibly, none at all. One thing is evident, however,
that a series of writings which discover the under-currents of
Scottish life in a busy century, would have been lost to literature,
and that whatever gain there may have in one direction, it
could hardly counter-balance the loss another way. Taking
Dougal Graham all in all, his uncultured energy, his ‘hameliness,’
and his ready wit, have won for him a place in Scottish
literature it would be difficult to supply, and which no one but
himself was qualified to occupy. What that place was we
shall endeavour to show in the following pages, when dealing
with the chap-literature of Scotland.</p>


    <div class="chapter"></div>
<hr class="r20" />
<h3 class="fs80"><a name="III_THE_CHAP-LIT" id="III_THE_CHAP-LIT"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">III.&mdash;THE CHAP-LITERATURE OF SCOTLAND.</a></h3>


<p>Fully half a century ago, William Motherwell, whose name
has been frequently mentioned in these pages, penned this
sentence:&mdash;‘A History of Vulgar Literature, from the earliest
of the present times, we believe, would form a valuable acquisition
to the libraries of the curious.’ About thirty years later
Dr. Strang expressed the same idea in terms somewhat
similar:&mdash;‘A history of the vulgar literature of Scotland has
been long and is unquestionably still, a desideratum, for
certainly nothing could tend to throw so much light on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
manners and tastes of the great body of the people as such a
work.’ Notwithstanding the lapse of time the work so much
desired has yet to be done; though Professor Fraser within
recent years has brought together, in a concise form, material
regarding chap-literature, which, before his work on the
Humorous Chap-Books of Scotland, was only to be found in
fragments in various books and magazines. By his own confession,
however, his work is merely an instalment, and, as we
have indicated, a history of the chap-literature of Scotland has
yet to be written. It is a matter to be regretted that the
popular works of last century&mdash;the works which found most
favour with the great mass of the people, and which, with the
addition of the Bible, was the bulk of their reading&mdash;should
have been over-looked. No complaint can be made of any
neglect of the higher walks in the profession of letters in the
eighteenth century. The philosophers, poets, novelists, and
historians of Scotland in the last century, have had at least
justice done them. But their works, for the most part, were
addressed to the educated, then a small proportion of the
population. Those who wrote for the people&mdash;for the uneducated
peasantry&mdash;have been ignored, a notable exception being
Burns, whose works were popular with all classes. Their
works were long considered to be unworthy of notice; and
out of a very large issue, there can now only be found a
few stray leaflets. With such material as can be had, a short
sketch of that literature is given in the following pages, for the
purpose of showing the place occupied in it by Dougal Graham.</p>

<p>‘Our fathers have told us,’ could the mediæval Scot say as
well as the ancient Israelite, for the traditions of former days
in ballad, song, and story, were handed down from generation
to generation. In the good old times, the gaberlunzie man
would rehearse, by the peat fire of some remote farm-house,
tales of the present and the past; or the discredited minstrel
of the ‘iron time’ would tune&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">&mdash;&mdash; ‘To please a peasant’s ear,</p>
<p class="verse0">The harp a king had loved to hear.’</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">From these, celebrated by royal and knightly poets, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
encircled by the halo of romance, we must descend to the
more prosaic, because better known, chapman, who, in a
latter age, filled their places. Travelling over the country
with a pack composed of haberdashery goods of the most
varied kind, and with coarsely printed specimens of the literature
to which his profession has given a name, he retailed at
each farm-house the news he had heard on his journeys; and
on a winter’s evening, by the kitchen fire, he could make the
time seem to pass swiftly, as he drew upon his experience for
stories of the most wonderful description, or recalled the days
of chivalry by his old-world tales. He was thus admitted to
the inner circle: he mixed with the people as one of themselves.</p>

<p>Having thus shown the chapman’s descent, it will be interesting
to notice the origin of the name given to his profession, if
it may be so called. Professor Fraser says ‘the prefix “chap”
originally meant “to cheap or cheapen,” as in the word
“cheapening-place,” meaning a market-place,&mdash;hence the
English Cheapside and Eastcheap.’ In addition, it may be
stated that the word ‘chapman’ is derived from the Anglo-Saxon
“ceap-man,” <em>ceap</em> meaning ‘a sale, or bargain’; and it
is related to the Suio-Gothic or Swedish <em>keop-a</em>, whence is
derived the Scottish ‘coup’ or ‘cowp,’ now confined to horse-selling,
colloquially spoken of as ‘horse-cowping.’ Another
illustration may be found in the name ‘Chepstow,’ a place in
Monmouthshire, meaning a market, or place for chapmen.
The general title of ‘chap-books’ was given to small tracts
hawked through the country by these worthies, who, however,
were willing to sell anything upon which they could make a
profit. Their business was a necessity of the times, when
roads were bad, when stage-coaches were hardly known, and
when railways would have been thought an impossibility and
absurdity. The people in the rural districts bought all their
smallwares from them; and the visit of the chapman to a
remote Lowland village, or Highland clachan, was an event
to be remembered by the women-folks far and near.</p>

<p>When and how the chap-literature of Scotland took its
origin it would be difficult to say with anything like precision.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
There is, however, good ground for the assumption that it may
have originated about the period of the Covenanting troubles,
and that it probably received its first material impetus from
the Revolution of 1688. As early as 1644, Zachary Boyd,
for some time minister of the Barony Parish of Glasgow, and
Vice-Chancellor of the University, complained to the General
Assembly about the ‘idle books, ... fables, love-songs,
baudry ballads, heathen husks, youth’s poison,’ in circulation.
Printing was then in its infancy in Scotland, and it is
interesting to note how, thus early in its existence, it sought
to extend to the people a cheap literature which, though
perhaps not of the most wholesome kind, might hardly be
deserving of the strictures of the stern presbyterian of the
seventeenth century. After the Restoration, a change appears
to have come over the popular literature; a new element was
introduced; and the internal evidence of the chap-books
relating to Peden, Cargill, and other worthies of the ‘killing
time,’ indicate that their first editions were published within a
few years at least of the events recorded in them. The press,
apparently, was made great use of by the preachers who had
been ousted from their pulpits; and many sermons were sent
out in the form of chap-books. In the second portion of the
library of the late Dr. David Laing, which was recently sold
off in London, there was an interesting volume of chap-books
relating chiefly to Scottish religious and ecclesiastical affairs.
Among others, it included the following:&mdash;‘Renwick (J.),
Man’s Great Concernment, 1687’; ‘Love (C.), Christ’s Glorious
Appearance, <em>Glasgow</em>, 1692’; and ‘Row (J.), Sermon commonly
known by the Pockmanty Preaching, <em>Edin.</em>, 1723.’
From what has been said, there seems to be little doubt that
the chap-literature of Scotland was of somewhat earlier origin
than that of England. A recent writer, referring to English
chap-books, says:&mdash;‘The Chap-book proper did not exist before
the former date [1700], unless the Civil War and political
tracts can be so termed. Doubtless these were hawked by the
pedlars, but they were not those penny worths, suitable to
everybody’s taste, and within the reach of anybody’s purse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
owing to their extremely low price, which must, or ought to
have, extracted every available copper in the village, when the
Chapman opened his budget of brand-new books.’<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>But happier times produced a further change on Scottish
chap-literature, which again included within its borders productions
of a less sober character than sermons and the lives
and opinions of martyrs, though these still held their ground
in public estimation. Among the chaps, the originals or early
reprints of which were published at the beginning of the
eighteenth century, were many of a religious or semi-religious
character, such as the following:&mdash;‘Last Words of Christian
Kerr, <em>Edin.</em>, 1708’; ‘Description of Jerusalem, <em>Edin.</em>, 1727’;
and ‘Last Words of Margaret Abercromby, <em>Edin.</em>, 1729.’
As for the ‘Pockmanty Preaching,’ already mentioned as
having been issued in 1723, it was one of a considerable
class which has been well represented in <cite>Scottish Presbyterian
Eloquence Displayed</cite>. About this time, also, Allan Ramsay
published many of his earlier poems in chap-book or broadside
form, and to this must be attributed the speedy hold he
took on the favour of the people. Chalmers, in his life of the
poet, says that after the year 1715, Ramsay ‘wrote many
petty poems, which from time to time he published at a proportionate
price. In this form, his poetry was at the time
attractive; and the women of Edinburgh were wont to send
out their children, with a penny, to buy “Ramsay’s last
piece.” ... On those principles he published, about the
year 1716, the “Christ’s Kirk on the Green.”’<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Though he did
not long continue this practice, he had afterwards to suffer some
annoyance by others doing it for him. In his ‘Address to the
Town Council of Edinburgh,’ written in 1721, he complains
that he had ‘suffer’d muckle wrang’ by ‘Lucky Reid and
ballad-singers,’ publishing a trashy edition of his pastoral on
Addison. He bewails the many mistakes in it, and says that
publication kept him from his natural rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The ‘Lucky Reid,’ mentioned in Ramsay’s complaint, was
the widow of John Reid, printer, in Bell’s Wynd, Edinburgh.
Reid did a large business in issuing scraps of popular literature.
He was the original publisher of many of the strange
productions of William Mitchell, <em>alias</em> ‘The Tinclarian
Doctor;’ an odd being who sought by his works to spread
‘light’ throughout Scotland. Mitchell was a lamplighter in
Edinburgh for twelve years, but, losing this situation, he got,
as he says himself, ‘an inward call from the Spirit, to give
light to the ministers.’ His works may be classed among the
chap-books of Scotland, for, though he sold them himself, and
did not allow them to be retailed by the chapmen, they are
of the same description.</p>

<p>Great activity in the publication of chap-books is known to
have been displayed by printers in the various cities and
towns in Scotland for the next decade or two; though, as far
as can be judged from the few remnants of their productions
still to be found, there was no author who, in any way, marked
the literature with his individuality. Small collections of
songs seem to have been in great request; old ballads were
reprinted, and extracts were made from the writings of many
of the poets; and the chap literature of England, which by
this time had attained to some maturity, was beginning to
make an impression on the Scottish people. Dream-books,
and small works relating to astrology, palmistry, physiognomy,
foreign travel, and such like, had become common, and were
hailed by the people with manifest delight. These publications,
issued at a price which put them within the reach of
all classes, served to keep alive the superstitious beliefs which
to this day are by no means eradicated from the popular
mind, and which occasionally show themselves in most
unlooked for quarters, and under the most extraordinary
circumstances. Even the semi-religious chap-books had a
tendency in this direction; and the so-called prophecies of the
leaders in the Covenanting movement were regarded as certain
of fulfilment, each change being eagerly watched and noticed
as having a bearing upon the utterance of some martyr to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
unholy zeal of the persecutors. As the general prophecies of
Thomas the Rhymer, the seer of Ercildoune, were regarded
as finding their fulfilment in the political events of the time;
as the prophecies of Mother Shipton have recently been
scanned, and even caused agitation among a nervous few, on
account of the prediction&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘The world to an end shall come,</p>
<p class="verse0">In eighteen hundred and eighty-one’;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">so were the sayings of Peden, Cargill, and others, believed to
be finding their realisation in the many actual and supposed
calamities that every now and then occurred within the land
for which they had suffered so much. An interesting notice
of the power of these books is furnished by the Rev. Dr.
Alexander Carlyle, minister of Inveresk, in the middle of last
century:&mdash;‘In the month of March or April this year [1744],
having gone down [from Glasgow] with a merchant to visit
New Port-Glasgow, as our dinner was preparing at the inn,
we were alarmed with the howling and weeping of half-a-dozen
of women in the kitchen, which was so loud and lasting
that I went to see what was the matter, when, after some time,
I learnt from the calmest among them that a pedlar had left a
copy of Peden’s <cite>Prophecies</cite> that morning, which having read
part of, they found that he had predicted woes of every kind to
the people of Scotland; and in particular that Clyde would run
with blood in the year 1744, which now being some months
advanced, they believed that their destruction was at hand. I
was puzzled how to pacify them, but calling for the book, I
found that the passage which had terrified them was contained
in the forty-fourth paragraph, without any allusion whatever to
the year; and by this means I quieted their lamentations.
Had the intended expedition of Mareschal Saxe been carried
into execution that year, as was intended, their fears might
have been realised.’<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> An instance of the supposed fulfilment
of a prophecy of Thomas the Rhymer, about this date, may
be cited from Dougal Graham’s <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Referring to Prestonpans, and after describing the battle
fought there on the 21st of September, 1745, between the
clans under Prince Charlie and the troops under Sir John
Cope, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘The place old Rhymer told long before,</p>
<p class="verse0">“That between Seaton and the sea,</p>
<p class="verse0">“A dreadful morning there should be,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Meet in the morning lighted by the moon,</p>
<p class="verse0">“The lion his wound here, heal shall not soon.”</p>
<p class="verse0">In Thomas’ book of this you’ll read,</p>
<p class="verse0">Mention’d by both Merlin and Bead.’</p>
</div></div>

<p>The publication, in 1746, of Dougal Graham’s <cite>History of
the Rebellion</cite>, marks the beginning of an important era in the
progress of the chap literature of Scotland. Larger than
most of the works hitherto issued to the public at a cheap
rate and through the medium of pedlars, the living interest it
possessed, by dealing with events and aspirations which at
that time still had a firm hold on the minds of the people,
gave it a popularity hardly less than that attained by the
smaller and cheaper productions preceding it. Even yet, it
possesses a unique position among its class. But the <cite>History</cite>
is also interesting in its relation to Scottish popular literature
in that it was the first known publication of an author
whose numerous works afterwards gave to it a distinctive
character, and elevated it to a rank certainly not equalled by
the kindred literature of England. It is probable that the
publication of Graham’s works extended from 1746 until his
death in 1779, the poetical pieces being first in order;
and, while there is no definite information on the point, it can
be fairly assumed that they from the first made a distinct
impression. Their predecessors, though they had a strong
hold upon the popular favour, treated for the most part either
with the theological and superstitious sides of the Scottish
nature, or with peculiarities common to every section of the
island. Dougal struck out a new line, described Scottish life
as he found it and knew it by personal observation and contact.
By this means he was able to present to his readers
vigorous pictures of the life they themselves lived, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
opinions they themselves expressed, the language in which
they spoke, and, above all, he could appeal to their likes and
dislikes in a way which none of his craft had done before, or
was able to do after him. These features in the works of
Dougal Graham gave him an unwonted popularity, and the
couplet in the preface to a late edition of <cite>John Falkirk’s
Cariches</cite> shows the estimation in which he was held:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘The wittiest fellow in his time,</p>
<p class="verse0">Either for Prose or making Rhyme.’</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The varied character of his works gave to the literature
of which they were a part a native strength that otherwise
would not have belonged to it; and while they may have, to
some extent, deepened the taint of coarseness which before
found a place within its ranks, they added to its value as
illustrating the tastes and manners of the common people.
To convince himself of the truth of this statement, all that the
reader requires to do is to note carefully the chap-books
written by Graham, either in contrast with others, or by themselves.
There is enough in them, without considering their
relation to others, to prove that statement, for their truthfulness
to human nature, and especially Scottish human nature,
appeals to the heart and convinces the judgment.</p>

<p>While Dougal Graham was thus actively employed, and
with so much effect, other writers were contributing their
quota to chapman literature. None of these authors can now
be traced, possibly because they kept their identity concealed,
but a few of their works still remain. One or two of them
may be noticed. In 1764, there were issued in Edinburgh
two chap-books which may be regarded as the forerunners of
the modern ‘letter-writers.’ One of them, <cite>The Art of Courtship</cite>,
contained ‘Amorous dialogues, love letters, complimental
expressions, with a particular description of Courtship, etc.’;
while the other bore the title of <cite>The Accomplished Courtier, or
A New School of Love</cite>. In the same city, in 1767, there was
published <cite>The Comical Notes and Sayings of the Reverend Mr.
John Pettegrew</cite>, minister in Govan. It contained stories,
humorous and sometimes very broad, about the reverend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
gentleman, but they had probably as little foundation in fact as
the extraordinary tales recorded of George Buchanan. There
are other chap-books with a popularity almost equal to those
named, and to the productions of Dougal Graham, such as&mdash;<cite>The
Wife of Beath</cite>, a metrical travesty of Chaucer’s tale; the
still highly esteemed <cite>Watty and Meg</cite>; <cite>Thrummy Cap</cite>; <cite>The
Dominie Deposed</cite>; <cite>Margaret and the Minister</cite>; and a host
of others.</p>

<p>Nothing that can be said to have given any new feature to
chap literature was published after Graham’s death, though it
still continued to be very popular. Many printers throughout
the country set themselves almost exclusively to its circulation,
which, it has been stated, had reached, before the close
of the century, a quarter of a million copies annually. The
old chap-books were reprinted in almost every town of any
note in Scotland, sometimes in full, sometimes abridged;
songs and ballads were collected and got up in chap-book and
broadside form; and extracts from larger works were made and
published in a guise under which their authors would have
had difficulty in recognising them. Dougal Graham, of
course, had great attention paid to him; and edition after
edition of his numerous works was scattered over the country;
while Robert Burns, then rising into fame as a poet, had
his writings reproduced in many of the collections of songs.
For the first twenty years of the present century the chap-books
enjoyed an unimpaired popularity, but they gradually
began to decline in favour. An impression of their vulgarity
got abroad, they were regarded by public moralists as pestilential
and therefore deserving extinction; some publishers
turned out from their presses ‘New and Improved Series,’ and
at last they came to be regarded as belonging to a bygone
age, worthy only of the consideration of antiquaries, some
utilitarians being doubtful if they even merited that attention.
The time had changed, and the popular taste had improved;
and, after 1832, Chambers’ <cite>Journal</cite> took the place among the
people formerly occupied by chap-books. As the taste for
reading increased, the <cite>Journal</cite> shared honours with other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
publications, until now the issue of ephemeral literature has
reached an extraordinary development. There are, however,
many still living who remember the days of chap-literature,
and who can recall the zest with which they first read the
adventures of ‘Louden Tam,’ ‘Leper the Tailor,’ ‘John Cheap,’
and all that race.</p>

<p>It would be impossible in this place to give a note of the
printers who assisted in the issue of the chap literature of
Scotland, though to do so would be highly interesting. Their
name is legion. Of the work of the earlier printers very few
specimens remain; but towards the end of last century some
of the printers in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Falkirk, and other
large towns, attained to quite a celebrity for their efforts in
this direction. James and Matthew Robertson, whose shop
was in the Saltmarket, between the Cross and what is now
known as St. Andrew’s Street, and who were in business at
the end of the eighteenth, and beginning of the nineteenth,
century, made about £30,000 off them. They published all
Dougal Graham’s booklets in their most complete forms,
besides everything of the chap-book kind then in circulation.
At their death their money went to the only daughter of
Matthew, and her reputation for benevolence to the poor long
survived her. Two other Saltmarket printers were Thomas
Duncan, at No. 159, and R. Hutchison, at No. 10, both of
whom flourished in the early years of this century. The
headquarters of the chap-book printers in Edinburgh were in
Niddery’s Wynd and the Cowgate. Some most valuable
pieces were issued from the Wynd about the middle of last
century; and, in the Cowgate in the early years of this century,
Morren printed all and sundry, scattering chap-books broadcast
over the east coast. About 1760, A. Robertson, Coalhill,
Leith, did an extensive business in this way. Falkirk, again,
occupies a high position in this respect, for during the last
few years of the eighteenth, and the early years of the present,
century, T. Johnston issued a large number of chap-books,
most of them valuable because they do not seem to have
been much, if any, abridged. C. and M. Randall, of Stirling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
about the same time were engaged in a similar work. Without
further detail, this list of these eminent printers may be
closed by the mention of the name of George Caldwell,
Paisley, who flourished in both centuries, and who is believed
to have been the original printer of many of Dougal Graham’s
chap-books. Few, if any, of his early productions can now
be found.</p>

<p>In concluding this necessarily brief outline of the history of
the chap-literature of Scotland, we may be allowed to quote
from <cite>The Thistle</cite>, a Glasgow magazine published in 1847. It
was edited by Alexander B. Grosart, the now eminent editor
of the Fuller Worthies’ Library, etc., who was at that time in
the employment of Dr. John Buchanan, the Glasgow banker
and antiquary. Mr. Grosart had in that magazine a quaintly
written article on ‘Chap-Beuks and Ballats,’ beginning in this
strain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">‘Chap-Beuks and Ballats</p>
<p class="verse8">&mdash;&mdash; “To rede are delectabill.</p>
<p class="verse8">Suppois that thai be nocht bot fabill;</p>
<p class="verse8">Then suld ‘auld storyss’ that suthfast were,</p>
<p class="verse8">Have ‘doubill pleasance.’”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">‘So said or sung “Makkar” Barbour in his “Quhair” of the
Bruce. Chap-beuks and Ballats occupied a “far-ben corner o’
the heart” of our Fathers and Grandfathers; indeed we have
a “doubill pleasaunce” in these “auld storyss” when “tauld
in gude manner.”’ Such is a true estimate of their position
in the hearts and minds of the Scots of the eighteenth century.
The opinions Sir Walter Scott and William Motherwell had of
Dougal Graham’s writings have already been shown, and their
estimate of the value of the literature for which he wrote has
been clearly brought out.</p>

<p>No one need regret that the days of chap-books are gone,
but the human mind has a tendency to turn with a loving
look to the past, as if life in it had been easier than in the
present. It is, however, another illustration of the familiar
adage that ‘distance lends enchantment to the view.’
These works, impossible now, must be regarded in the light
in which Dean Ramsay prepared his <cite>Reminiscences</cite>. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
object was to ‘depict a phase of national manners which was
fast passing away, and thus, in however humble a department,
contribute something to the materials of history, by exhibiting
social customs and habits of thought which at a particular
era were characteristic of a race.’<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Such is the value of the
remnants of the once extensive chap literature of Scotland.
With a finer public taste, and a purer, though not more
vigorous, popular literature, these old books are now discredited
except for antiquarian purposes. Perhaps the change
cannot be better shown than in the illustration given by Dean
Ramsay, who says in his ‘Conclusion’:&mdash;‘In 1821, Mrs. Keith
of Ravelstone, grand-aunt of Sir Walter Scott, thus writes, in
returning to him the work of a female novelist which she had
borrowed from him out of curiosity, and to remind her of
“auld lang syne:”&mdash;“Is it not a very odd thing that I, an old
woman of eighty and upwards, sitting alone, feel myself
ashamed to read a book which, sixty years ago, I have heard
read aloud for the amusement of large circles, consisting of the
first and most creditable society in London!”’<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> It is well
that such should be the case; but it is in the interests of the
purity of public morals, of the progress of national life, that
these old land-marks should be preserved; for by them only
can we tell of the manners and customs of our forefathers, or
estimate what advancement has been made since their time.</p>

<p class="verse0">A man-of-war, with arms and coin,</p>
<p class="verse0">To be his guardian ship, and store,</p>
<p class="verse0">But could not reach the British shore;</p>
<p class="verse0">Altho’ well mann’d with sixty guns,</p>
<p class="verse0">The English Lion, made blood and wounds,</p>
<p class="verse0">Her captain slew, and seventy more;</p>
<p class="verse0">Made all her crew with wounds and gore,</p>
<p class="verse0">Fly with the wind in haste to France,</p>
<p class="verse0">And into Brest they got by chance.</p>
<p class="verse0">Right narrowly, escaping sinking,</p>
<p class="verse0">Show’rs of balls around them clinking.</p>
<p class="verse0">Thus by the Lion, and captain Brett,</p>
<p class="verse0">He and his convoy, were separate.</p>
<p class="verse0">His frigate eleven guns did carry,</p>
<p class="verse0">But on the battle, she did not tarry,</p>
<p class="verse0">And thought it best to get away,</p>
<p class="verse0">Because he’d been the richest prey:</p>
<p class="verse0">The Scottish coast, he reach’d at last,</p>
<p class="verse0">Amongst the Isles, into the west;</p>
<p class="verse0">Near Lochaber, there did he land,</p>
<p class="verse0">At Kinloch-moidart, I understand;</p>
<p class="verse0">With one Macdonald he did stay,</p>
<p class="verse0">And on his standard, did display</p>
<p class="verse0">This motto, <span class="smcap">Tandem Triumphans</span>,</p>
<p class="verse0">At length triumphant, the English is.</p>
<p class="verse0">His <span class="smcap">Manifestoes</span>, also spread,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Which for the Scots, great favour had;</p>
<p class="verse0">How that the Union, he’d dissolve,</p>
<p class="verse0">And the tax from Malt, Salt and Coal;</p>
<p class="verse0">And as for the High Church of England,</p>
<p class="verse0">As now establish’d, ’twas to stand:</p>
<p class="verse0">But for Scots Kirk, call’d Presbytry,</p>
<p class="verse0">He would consider at more delay.</p>
<p class="verse0">This set the clergy on his tap,</p>
<p class="verse0">And kept some thousands from the trap,</p>
<p class="verse0">Wherein with him they had been snar’d</p>
<p class="verse0">If under arms, they had appear’d.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Highland Chiefs drew clans together,</p>
<p class="verse0">But of the end, did not consider,</p>
<p class="verse0">If their designs, miscarry should,</p>
<p class="verse0">How that they were, of all befool’d.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Camrons rose, headed by Lochiel,</p>
<p class="verse0">And Stewarts did under Appin dwell,</p>
<p class="verse0">With the Macdonalds of Glengary.</p>
<p class="verse0">These clans did first his arms carry,</p>
<p class="verse0">Numbred one thousand, eight hundred men,</p>
<p class="verse0">But badly arm’d, as you may ken;</p>
<p class="verse0">With lockless guns, and rusty swords,</p>
<p class="verse0">Durks and pistols of ancient sorts,</p>
<p class="verse0">Old scythes, with their rumples even,</p>
<p class="verse0">Into a tree, they had them driv’n;</p>
<p class="verse0">And some, with battons of good oak,</p>
<p class="verse0">Vow’d to kill at every stroke:</p>
<p class="verse0">Some had hatchets upon a pole,</p>
<p class="verse0">Mischievous weapons, antick and droll,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was both for cleaving and for clieking,</p>
<p class="verse0">And durking too, their way of speaking.</p>
<p class="verse0">Their uniform, was belted plaids,</p>
<p class="verse0">Bonnets of blew upon their heads,</p>
<p class="verse0">With white cockade and naked thie</p>
<p class="verse0">Of foot, as nimble as may be.</p>
<p class="verse0">The rumour spread thro’ all the land,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of the Pretender and his band,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Then two companies padrolling went</p>
<p class="verse0">Of Sinclair’s soldiers, with intent,</p>
<p class="verse0">For to disperse this rebel crew,</p>
<p class="verse0">But found it was too hard to do;</p>
<p class="verse0">Being surrounded by the way,</p>
<p class="verse0">And forc’d their arms down to lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">They prisoners of war were made,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or with them list, they freedom had;</p>
<p class="verse0">And, Swethenham of Guise’s foot,</p>
<p class="verse0">But he on parole, release got,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who gave the real authentic count</p>
<p class="verse0">What strength, the Highland pow’rs did mount,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who did command, what clans they were,</p>
<p class="verse0">How they encamped, when and where.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then Sir John Cope gen’ralissimo,</p>
<p class="verse0">Troops in Scotland prepar’d to go,</p>
<p class="verse0">Break and scatter them, if he might,</p>
<p class="verse0">Before they came to a great height,</p>
<p class="verse0">And all inventions did contrive,</p>
<p class="verse0">To catch that Prince, dead or alive.</p>
<p class="verse0">A proclamation there was made,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of thirty thousand<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> for his head,</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet this did not prevent his friends,</p>
<p class="verse0">Him to assist with men, and means,</p>
<p class="verse0">From different corners of the land,</p>
<p class="verse0">They came for to augment his band.</p>
<p class="verse0">But Cope into the North he went,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thinking their growth for to prevent;</p>
<p class="verse0">With all the foot he could collect,</p>
<p class="verse0">Light arm’d they were, thinking to break</p>
<p class="verse0">And scatter a wild unarmed crew,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who that of fighting, nothing knew.</p>
<p class="verse0">The horse he made at Stirling stay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Under the wall encamp’d they lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">While he march’d on from hill to hill,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">But them to find he had no skill,</p>
<p class="verse0">For Charles sent in their way a scout,</p>
<p class="verse0">At which they follow’d close pursuit,</p>
<p class="verse0">O’er the mountains to Inverness;</p>
<p class="verse0">Before he heard where Charlie was,</p>
<p class="verse0">Possessed of the town of Perth,</p>
<p class="verse0">And there was join’d by men of worth,</p>
<p class="verse0">The Drummonds and duke John by name</p>
<p class="verse0">Whose stile was Perth, of noble fame;</p>
<p class="verse0">There Elcho came, and Broughton too,</p>
<p class="verse0">With Balmarino not a few,</p>
<p class="verse0">Kilmarnock also gave consent</p>
<p class="verse0">And afterwards unto them went,</p>
<p class="verse0">With many more, from north to south,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of gentlemen, the flow’r of youth.</p>
<p class="verse0">Here of Prince Regent, he took the name,</p>
<p class="verse0">And his royal Father did proclaim,</p>
<p class="verse0">King of Great Britain, and Ireland,</p>
<p class="verse0">With all its titles, you’ll understand;</p>
<p class="verse0">And here they lifted tax and cess,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which did the lieges sore oppress,</p>
<p class="verse0">And what was worse, I understand</p>
<p class="verse0">Without his knowledge or command,</p>
<p class="verse0">Some thievish bands, in many parts,</p>
<p class="verse0">To cloak their rog’ry, us’d these arts,</p>
<p class="verse0">In tartan dress’d from top to toe,</p>
<p class="verse0">Arms and livery had also;</p>
<p class="verse0">Plunder’d the country where they went,</p>
<p class="verse0">Profess’d they by the Prince were sent,</p>
<p class="verse0">To levy horse, men and money,</p>
<p class="verse0">Extorting cash and horse from many;</p>
<p class="verse0">Excise and cess made people pay,</p>
<p class="verse0">And gave receipts, so just were they:</p>
<p class="verse0">A famous way for making rich,</p>
<p class="verse0">But Charlie got the blame of such,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which did his merit sore defame,</p>
<p class="verse0">And gave his men a thievish name.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Many of his crew indeed were greedy,</p>
<p class="verse0">To fill their bellies when they were needy;</p>
<p class="verse0">They cocks and hens, and churns and cheese</p>
<p class="verse0">Did kill and eat, when they could seize,</p>
<p class="verse0">And when owners did them exclaim;</p>
<p class="verse0">“<em>Hup poup</em>, hersel be far frae hame,</p>
<p class="verse0">“You need not fash to say no thing,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Hersel brings you a bra’ new king.”</p>
<p class="verse0">From Perth they march’d unto Dumblane,</p>
<p class="verse0">And then by Down the road they’ve ta’en;</p>
<p class="verse0">By Stirling bridge they could not go,</p>
<p class="verse0">Fearing the castle, and troops also,</p>
<p class="verse0">Gard’ner and Hamilton’s dragoons</p>
<p class="verse0">Which lay encampt between the towns</p>
<p class="verse0">Of St. Ninians and Stirling wall,</p>
<p class="verse0">Impatiently waiting the call,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thinking John Cope was on their rear,</p>
<p class="verse0">Though no tidings could from him hear.</p>
<p class="verse0">They watch’d their motions day and night</p>
<p class="verse0">But five miles distant in their sight;</p>
<p class="verse0">Until inform’d by an express,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of Cope’s marching from Inverness,</p>
<p class="verse0">And then was bound for Aberdeen,</p>
<p class="verse0">From thence to sail for East Lothi’n:</p>
<p class="verse0">And so from Stirling to retreat,</p>
<p class="verse0">On his arrival there to wait;</p>
<p class="verse0">And were by no means to oppose</p>
<p class="verse0">Them on their march, or come to blows,</p>
<p class="verse0">Until the foot and horse unite;</p>
<p class="verse0">This was John Cope’s orders complete,</p>
<p class="verse0">While Charles yet, he lay at Down,</p>
<p class="verse0">And the dragoons at Stirling town:</p>
<p class="verse0">A council call’d at his desire,</p>
<p class="verse0">Held in the house of Arnprior,</p>
<p class="verse0">With chiefs and heads of ev’ry clan,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their expedition south to plan.</p>
<p class="verse0">Some was with Gard’ner for to fight,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">And others said, that was not right;</p>
<p class="verse0">Unless in Glens, or mountain tops,</p>
<p class="verse0">To fight horsemen they had no hopes.</p>
<p class="verse0">If field they lost, what could they do,</p>
<p class="verse0">Nought but their heels could them rescue;</p>
<p class="verse0">We’ll cross the Forth, then take the hill</p>
<p class="verse0">Where horse can do us little ill;</p>
<p class="verse0">Thus take the South at any rate,</p>
<p class="verse0">Arms and money we’ll surely get:</p>
<p class="verse0">Then shall we be more fit by far,</p>
<p class="verse0">To fight with men that’s learn’d in war.</p>
<p class="verse0">And that in field open and plain,</p>
<p class="verse0">The victory they’d surely gain;</p>
<p class="verse0">The mountain road ’tween Forth and Clyde,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where’s glens and bogs on ev’ry side,</p>
<p class="verse0">A famous field, if need there be</p>
<p class="verse0">We’ll fight with more securitie.</p>
<p class="verse0">Perhaps these horse will not us face,</p>
<p class="verse0">Because no foot is in the place;</p>
<p class="verse0">For certain, they’ll not fight alone</p>
<p class="verse0">Without infantry to lead them on.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then reply’d Stewart of Glenbuck,</p>
<p class="verse0">“We’re them that loup before we look;</p>
<p class="verse0">“What madness is’t for so few, he said,</p>
<p class="verse0">“To ’ttempt down pulling a crown’d head;</p>
<p class="verse0">“’Bout two thousand is our number,</p>
<p class="verse0">“What can we do, but raise a rumour,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Though all be north us could be trusted,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Yet by the South we will be worsted;</p>
<p class="verse0">“Without a num’rous aid from France,</p>
<p class="verse0">“With them we can have little chance.</p>
<p class="verse0">“A people that’s to Whiggism bound,</p>
<p class="verse0">“With life and blood will keep their ground;</p>
<p class="verse0">“And ’mongst them if we broken be,</p>
<p class="verse0">“For shelter then, where can we flee?</p>
<p class="verse0">“We already stand ’tween two fires,</p>
<p class="verse0">“And yet go South is your desires.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">“There’s Cope behind, Gard’ner before;</p>
<p class="verse0">“Beat one of these, I’ll say no more.</p>
<p class="verse0">“Gain but one battle, and then pursue,</p>
<p class="verse0">“’Twill raise your fame and army too;</p>
<p class="verse0">“But still run forward and be chac’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">“That is no conquest but a jest.</p>
<p class="verse0">“I’ll rather choose to turn about,</p>
<p class="verse0">“And try our might, this Cope to rout;</p>
<p class="verse0">“For if the two rejoin, ’tis true,</p>
<p class="verse0">“We’ll find the work more hard to do;</p>
<p class="verse0">“First break the foot, if that ye may,</p>
<p class="verse0">“The horse then will no longer stay.”</p>
<p class="verse0">At this high speech they took offence,</p>
<p class="verse0">And charg’d him and his men, go hence;</p>
<p class="verse0">For such a tim’rous soul as he,</p>
<p class="verse0">Should not go in their companie:</p>
<p class="verse0">A cow’rd, they said, so full of care,</p>
<p class="verse0">Would fill their troops with dread and fear;</p>
<p class="verse0">No trust he had in Providence,</p>
<p class="verse0">In feats of war could have no chance.</p>
<p class="verse0">And thus their counsel ends in rage,</p>
<p class="verse0">Glenbucket’s schemes they’ll not engage,</p>
<p class="verse0">But call’d him cow’rd and shabby names,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who ’gainst their eager plan exclaims;</p>
<p class="verse0">And in their strife they parted so,</p>
<p class="verse0">Glenbucket to his sleep did go;</p>
<p class="verse0">But how it happen’d none can tell,</p>
<p class="verse0">Such accident on him befel:</p>
<p class="verse0">They were alarmed with a shot,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then found him bleeding on the spot;</p>
<p class="verse0">Into the bed he lay alone,</p>
<p class="verse0">But friend nor foe, with him was none.</p>
<p class="verse0">Whether it was dregs of remorse,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or thoughtful of the dang’rous course</p>
<p class="verse0">He was engag’d to undergo;</p>
<p class="verse0">But here he di’d, that’s what I know.</p>
<p class="verse0">His men the body carried home,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">And decently did him intomb;</p>
<p class="verse0">And through displeasure of the act,</p>
<p class="verse0">Not one of them returned back.</p>
<p class="verse0">September, on the thirteenth day,</p>
<p class="verse0">From Down they march’d in good array;</p>
<p class="verse0">And at the Frew they cross’d the Forth,</p>
<p class="verse0">The only passage from the North;</p>
<p class="verse0">Without the help of boat or brigs,</p>
<p class="verse0">Charles himself first wet his legs;</p>
<p class="verse0">Being on the front of all his foot,</p>
<p class="verse0">For help of horse there sought he not;</p>
<p class="verse0">And on the south bank there he stood,</p>
<p class="verse0">’Till all of them, had pass’d the flood.</p>
<p class="verse0">Here for a space they took a rest,</p>
<p class="verse0">And had refreshment of the best</p>
<p class="verse0">The country round them could afford,</p>
<p class="verse0">Though many found but empty board;</p>
<p class="verse0">As sheep and cattle were drove away,</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet hungry men sought for their prey:</p>
<p class="verse0">Took milk and butter, kirns and cheese;</p>
<p class="verse0">On all kinds of eatables, they seize:</p>
<p class="verse0">And he who could not get a share,</p>
<p class="verse0">Sprang to the hills like dogs for hare;</p>
<p class="verse0">There shot the sheep, and made them fall,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whirl’d off the skin and that was all;</p>
<p class="verse0">Struck up fires and broil’d the flesh,</p>
<p class="verse0">With salt and pepper, did not fash.</p>
<p class="verse0">This did enrage the Cam’ron’s chief,</p>
<p class="verse0">To see his men so play the thief;</p>
<p class="verse0">And finding one into the act,</p>
<p class="verse0">He fir’d and shot him through the back:</p>
<p class="verse0">Then to the rest himself addrest,</p>
<p class="verse0">“This is your lot, I do protest,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Who e’er amongst you wrongs a man,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Pay what you get, I tell you plain;</p>
<p class="verse0">“For yet we know not friend or foe,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Or how all things may chance to go.”</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">And then to arms they order’d were,</p>
<p class="verse0">On thoughts of Gard’ner’s coming there:</p>
<p class="verse0">But finding that he did decline,</p>
<p class="verse0">They took the hills on some design,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where men on horse could hardly sit,</p>
<p class="verse0">They speal’d the rocks like goat or cat.</p>
<p class="verse0">Out o’r the top, above Red-ha’,</p>
<p class="verse0">To th’ moor of Touch went one and a’,</p>
<p class="verse0">And in that moor lay all that night,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where Stirling castle’s in their sight,</p>
<p class="verse0">About three miles south from the town,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which made Gard’ner to leave his ground,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who lay encampt in Stirling park,</p>
<p class="verse0">And judging they might in the dark</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon him have some rude design,</p>
<p class="verse0">For which his camp he did resign,</p>
<p class="verse0">But for Falkirk they march’d away,</p>
<p class="verse0">And all that night in field they lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Between Larbour and Falkirk town,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then the morrow were eastward bound,</p>
<p class="verse0">Through Lithgow to Edinburgh went,</p>
<p class="verse0">To meet with Cope was his intent.</p>
<p class="verse0">When Charlie found that they were fled,</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon their rear, his front he led,</p>
<p class="verse0">And near to Stirling marched by,</p>
<p class="verse0">While the castle at him let fly;</p>
<p class="verse0">But being too far, and badly serv’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Nought but terror was observed;</p>
<p class="verse0">Which made th’ straglers mend their bicker,</p>
<p class="verse0">And only run a pace the quicker;</p>
<p class="verse0">Which kept them in from seeking plunder,</p>
<p class="verse0">And cry, “That pe o’er muckle thunder.”</p>
<p class="verse0">So through St. Ninian’s they passed wi’ speed;</p>
<p class="verse0">To Bannockburn they did proceed,</p>
<p class="verse0">There on the moor lay down to rest,</p>
<p class="verse0">And from their friends got a repast,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of what the country could afford,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">As of ’munition they were not stor’d;</p>
<p class="verse0">Neither of bread nor baggage carts,</p>
<p class="verse0">Got bread and ale to cheer their hearts.</p>
<p class="verse0">Came crowding in many a hunder</p>
<p class="verse0">And all to keep them back from plunder;</p>
<p class="verse0">As hunger will make men to steal.</p>
<p class="verse0">Forsooth they took both brose and kail,</p>
<p class="verse0">And when refresh’d, they march’d away</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet some indeed forgot to pay.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then through Torwood with speed they past,</p>
<p class="verse0">To Callender house they came at last,</p>
<p class="verse0">A little by east Falkirk town</p>
<p class="verse0">Where store of arms in it they foun’,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whereof they surely stood in need.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then to Linlithgow did proceed;</p>
<p class="verse0">Op’ned the pris’n in search of more,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thinking to seize on Gard’ner’s store,</p>
<p class="verse0">But th’ information was but mocks,</p>
<p class="verse0">For all they found was sacking frocks,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which troopers use dressing their horse,</p>
<p class="verse0">This made Hersel to rage and curse,</p>
<p class="verse0">Saying, “Het, tat soger has been chac’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">“And left his auld sark in the haste.”</p>
<p class="verse0">To Borrowst’ness they did advance,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where powder and lead they found by chance;</p>
<p class="verse0">To Winceburgh then, they march’d that day</p>
<p class="verse0">And form’d a camp in regular way,</p>
<p class="verse0">About eight miles from Edin. west,</p>
<p class="verse0">Expecting to be ’ttack’d in haste</p>
<p class="verse0">By horse, cit’zens and city-guard,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who all for marching were prepar’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thinking, upon Corstorphin plain,</p>
<p class="verse0">To give them battle they did intend:</p>
<p class="verse0">But yet the Achans in the town</p>
<p class="verse0">Advis’d to lay all arms down.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then Gen’ral Guest to the castle went,</p>
<p class="verse0">Perceiving what was their intent</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">With what arms and reg’lars he had,</p>
<p class="verse0">For nought they should not it invade.</p>
<p class="verse0">When Charles found how all might be,</p>
<p class="verse0">He marched on courageouslie,</p>
<p class="verse0">Within two miles west from the town;</p>
<p class="verse0">Then by Slateford took compass round,</p>
<p class="verse0">By the south side of Burrow-muir,</p>
<p class="verse0">Out of the castle’s sight and power.</p>
<p class="verse0">South from the city he camp’d again,</p>
<p class="verse0">While the surrender was made plain.</p>
<p class="verse0">In the night, September the seventeen,</p>
<p class="verse0">Into the city all marched in;</p>
<p class="verse0">Which gave to many a sad surprize,</p>
<p class="verse0">Rapping at their doors to make them rise:</p>
<p class="verse0">The castle then struck round her clear,</p>
<p class="verse0">None in its sight there durst appear.</p>
<p class="verse0">They fix’d a guard at the West-bow-head,</p>
<p class="verse0">And the Weigh-house their Guard-house made,</p>
<p class="verse0">Crowding it full, ’bove and below;</p>
<p class="verse0">When this the Castle came to know,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their half-moon-cannons ’gan to play:</p>
<p class="verse0">Like mad-men then they ran away;</p>
<p class="verse0">But such a <em>furich</em> was never there,</p>
<p class="verse0">As they tumbled headlong down the stair:</p>
<p class="verse0">All in a haste got out together,</p>
<p class="verse0">And riding one above another;</p>
<p class="verse0">Each striving foremost for to get,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their naked hips and noses met.</p>
<p class="verse0">They centries kept at the West-port,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which did afford the Castle sport:</p>
<p class="verse0">As oftentimes they did let fly,</p>

<p class="verse0">And also on the Castle-hill,</p>

behaviour there.</em></p>


<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Now, at Dunbar, both foot and horse</p>
<p class="verse0">Were join’d again, with full purpose,</p>
<p class="verse0">The proud Pretender’s force to try,</p>
<p class="verse0">And all the Highland pow’rs defy:</p>
<p class="verse0">Commanded by Cope and fur’ous Fowke,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who, alas! their plan had quite mistook;</p>
<p class="verse0">Though Loudon and Gard’ner both were there,</p>
<p class="verse0">They in council had, but little share:</p>
<p class="verse0">For Cope he challeng’d the sole command,</p>
<p class="verse0">And Fowke was still at his demand.</p>
<p class="verse0">A day’s march made from Haddington,</p>
<p class="verse0">Judg’d great fatigue, four miles of ground.</p>
<p class="verse0">Between Cow-canny and Tranent</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">There Cope encamp’d, to council went,</p>
<p class="verse0">Loudon and Gard’ner were of a mind,</p>
<p class="verse0">That night to fight were well design’d:</p>
<p class="verse0">Cope shamm’d it till another day,</p>
<p class="verse0">In hope ’twould prove a cheaper way:</p>
<p class="verse0">“Old men and boys, he said, would run,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Sight of his army would them stun,</p>
<p class="verse0">“A rabble undisciplin’d to fight,</p>
<p class="verse0">“They neither have courage nor might.</p>
<p class="verse0">“This day we’ve march’d enough, you’ll grant,</p>
<p class="verse0">“T’ morrow we’ll make the rogues repent.”</p>
<p class="verse0">&mdash;&mdash; With that the Highlanders appear’d</p>
<p class="verse0">(While Cope huzza’d, mocked and jeer’d)</p>
<p class="verse0">On the hill top bewest Tranent,</p>
<p class="verse0">All in good order, for battle bent.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then Cope began to Cannonade,</p>
<p class="verse0">So back behind the hill they fled,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thought it too hard to face his shot,</p>
<p class="verse0">As ’tween them lay a ditch or moat;</p>
<p class="verse0">Their Chiefs in council quickly chose</p>
<p class="verse0">On the east side Cope to enclose,</p>
<p class="verse0">South, north and west, he was hemm’d in,</p>
<p class="verse0">No ways but one could at him win.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">This was about the hour of two,</p>
<p class="verse0">When first they did each other view.</p>
<p class="verse0">The afternoon was fair and clear;</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet Sir John Cope stopt all, we hear,</p>
<p class="verse0">The fields are plain around Tranent,</p>
<p class="verse0">Besouth the town grow whins and bent,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where Charles kept his men secure,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thinking on battle ev’ry hour.</p>
<p class="verse0">But, Cope to move no man could treat,</p>
<p class="verse0">More than he had been Arthur’s seat,</p>
<p class="verse0">On which hillside he spy’d some men,</p>
<p class="verse0">And vow’d they were the Rebel train,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which was divided in parties two,</p>
<p class="verse0">And on his rear in ambush drew;</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">For which the piece of ground he chus’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">As on all sides it was inclos’d.</p>
<p class="verse0">So under arms they stood all night,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till break of day began the fight.</p>
<p class="verse0">His troops indeed, none can deny,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were form’d in order gallantly;</p>
<p class="verse0">The foot into the centre stood,</p>
<p class="verse0">And cavalry, wings covered,</p>
<p class="verse0">With each battalion was seen</p>
<p class="verse0">Counter guards, cannons between.</p>
<p class="verse0">All night he in this posture stood,</p>
<p class="verse0">While Charlie in a bushy wood,</p>
<p class="verse0">A little bewest of Seaton-town,</p>
<p class="verse0">Picquets and spies went him around,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lay undiscover’d till break of day,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then rouz’d like lions for their prey,</p>
<p class="verse0">In full brigades and oval form,</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon Cope’s front came as a storm,</p>
<p class="verse0">The orders were not for to fire,</p>
<p class="verse0">Until they came a little nigh’r;</p>
<p class="verse0">To sham the first fell to the ground,</p>
<p class="verse0">By which means few receiv’d a wound:</p>
<p class="verse0">And ere they gave the other charge,</p>
<p class="verse0">They on them with their sword and targe.</p>
<p class="verse0">The furious Cam’rons, led by Lochiel,</p>
<p class="verse0">With hideous cries gave such a knell</p>
<p class="verse0">As frighted both dragoons and horse,</p>
<p class="verse0">They could not fight, but rore and curse:</p>
<p class="verse0">And Sir John Cope, for all his might,</p>
<p class="verse0">Went with the foremost out of sight.</p>
<p class="verse0">Fierce Fowke, brave Hume and Loudon both,</p>
<p class="verse0">For to be ta’en that day were loth,</p>
<p class="verse0">Few of the horsemen stood at all,</p>
<p class="verse0">Woe to their conduct! worst of all;</p>
<p class="verse0">For those who on the right wing stood,</p>
<p class="verse0">A whole battalion over rode,</p>
<p class="verse0">That kept the rear <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Corps de garde</i></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Quite over them they headlong tread.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">One thing they knew, they were inclos’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">And where to flee, was not dispos’d:</p>
<p class="verse0">They always sought the way they came,</p>
<p class="verse0">Though in their face were sword and flame:</p>
<p class="verse0">So when they got down to the sea,</p>
<p class="verse0">Took east the coast most furiouslie:</p>
<p class="verse0">And some through Preston vennal fled,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then west by Mussleburgh they raid,</p>
<p class="verse0">Up to the hills above Dalkeith,</p>
<p class="verse0">O’er Sutrae hill, then out of skaith,</p>
<p class="verse0">In such a pannic, ’twas a shame,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ran thirty miles, even to Coldstream,</p>
<p class="verse0">And there to rest they would not yet;</p>
<p class="verse0">But unto Berwick, next morning set,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where all the fugitives did meet,</p>
<p class="verse0">And Sir John Cope his cheeks did weet;</p>
<p class="verse0">Because they swore he had sold them,</p>
<p class="verse0">To fight nor flee he ne’er told them.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">The poor foot, left here, paid for all,</p>
<p class="verse0">Not in fair battle, with powder and ball;</p>
<p class="verse0">But horrid swords, of dreadful length,</p>
<p class="verse0">So fast came on, with spite and strength,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lochaber axes and rusty scythes,</p>
<p class="verse0">Durks and daggers prick’d their thighs:</p>
<p class="verse0">Fix’d bay’nets had but little share</p>
<p class="verse0">With the long shanked weapons there;</p>
<p class="verse0">Although they kept together fast,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their en’mies close upon them prest;</p>
<p class="verse0">And back to back long did they stand,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till lost was many a head and hand.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then after Gard’ner’s party’s beat,</p>
<p class="verse0">The whole of’s horsemen clean defeat,</p>
<p class="verse0">Himself on foot rejoic’d to see</p>
<p class="verse0">The brave lads fight so valiantly,</p>
<p class="verse0">With no commander on their head,</p>
<p class="verse0">To join that party swift he gade:</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Although some wounds he’d got before,</p>
<p class="verse0">To lose the field his heart was sore.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then all around he was enclos’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Behind, before, fiercely oppos’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">With sword in hand he hew’d his way,</p>
<p class="verse0">While blood in streams did from him fly.</p>
<p class="verse0">Ere him down on the field they got,</p>
<p class="verse0">His head was clove, his body shot,</p>
<p class="verse0">And being sep’rate from the rest,</p>
<p class="verse0">The battle sore upon him prest,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ev’n after he lay on the ground,</p>
<p class="verse0">No mercy was unto him shown,</p>
<p class="verse0">I mean by the rude vulgar core,</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet gentlemen lamented sore;</p>
<p class="verse0">Because he would no quarter have,</p>
<p class="verse0">While they endeavour’d ’s live to save.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">One man he had, who by him staid,</p>
<p class="verse0">Until he on the field was laid,</p>
<p class="verse0">And then he fled to the Meadow-mill,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where he acquainted was right well,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thence in disguise return’d again,</p>
<p class="verse0">And bore him off, from ’mongst the slain.</p>
<p class="verse0">His stately dwelling was near by;</p>
<p class="verse0">But now he could not lift an eye,</p>
<p class="verse0">His speech was laid, all hopes were gone</p>
<p class="verse0">No signs of life, except a groan.</p>
<p class="verse0">Of hours he liv’d but very few,</p>
<p class="verse0">“A good Christi’n and soldi’r too,”</p>
<p class="verse0">This character he’s left behind</p>
<p class="verse0">Military men there’s few of ’s kind.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">The poor foot, on field, I can’t forget,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who now were caught as in a net,</p>
<p class="verse0">From ’bove Cow-canny to Preston-dyke,</p>
<p class="verse0">About a mile or near the like,</p>
<p class="verse0">They were beat backward by the clans,</p>
<p class="verse0">Along the crofts ’bove Preston-pans,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till the high dyke held them again,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Where many taken were and slain;</p>
<p class="verse0">Although they did for quarters cry,</p>
<p class="verse0">The vulgar clans made this reply,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Quarters! you curst soldiers, mad,</p>
<p class="verse0">“It is o’er soon to go to bed.”</p>
<p class="verse0">Had not their officers and chiefs</p>
<p class="verse0">Sprung in and begg’d for their reliefs,</p>
<p class="verse0">They had not left one living there:</p>
<p class="verse0">For in a desp’rate rage they were,</p>
<p class="verse0">’Cause many clans were hack’d and slain;</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet of their loss they let not ken:</p>
<p class="verse0">For by the shot fell not a few,</p>
<p class="verse0">And many with bay’nets pierc’d thro’.</p>
<p class="verse0">’Bove three hundred lay on the field,</p>
<p class="verse0">Fifteen hundred were forced to yield,</p>
<p class="verse0">The rest with Cope got clear away.</p>
<p class="verse0">And so ended this bloody fray,</p>
<p class="verse0">Since call’d the battle of Preston-pans,</p>
<p class="verse0">Fought by John Cope and Charlie’s clans,</p>
<p class="verse0">September the twenty-first day,</p>
<p class="verse0">Below Tranent a little way;</p>
<p class="verse0">From Gladsmoor church two miles and more,</p>
<p class="verse0">The place old Rhymer told long before,</p>
<p class="verse0">“That between Seaton and the sea,</p>
<p class="verse0">“A dreadful morning there should be,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Meet in the morning lighted by the moon,</p>
<p class="verse0">“The lion his wound here, heal shall not soon.”</p>
<p class="verse0">In Thomas’ book of this you’ll read,</p>
<p class="verse0">Mention’d by both Merlin and Bead.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Now, the field tents and warlike store</p>
<p class="verse0">And cannons, which they’d not before,</p>
<p class="verse0">All fell into the conq’rers hand,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of arms many a hundred stand.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">To Edinburgh then he did return,</p>
<p class="verse0">His great triumph made many mourn.</p>
<p class="verse0">Through Lothian then it was the way,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whose man ye was ye durst not say.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Nor to what side you’d wish good speed;</p>
<p class="verse0">So critical were times indeed.</p>
<p class="verse0">To Holyrood-house, great Charles then,</p>
<p class="verse0">Went in with all his noblemen,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being low out of the castle’s view</p>
<p class="verse0">There to him flocked not a few,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who were in dread to come before;</p>
<p class="verse0">But now they thought the conquest o’er,</p>
<p class="verse0">Rich presents were unto him sent,</p>
<p class="verse0">And much time in gallanting spent.</p>
<p class="verse0">His army here strove to recruit,</p>
<p class="verse0">Large collections were contribute,</p>
<p class="verse0">Taxes, cess, and all king’s dues,</p>
<p class="verse0">His orders no man durst refuse.</p>
<p class="verse0">The whole country and neighbouring towns</p>
<p class="verse0">Obediently sent in their pounds:</p>
<p class="verse0">Horses and carts they did provide,</p>
<p class="verse0">And men likewise these carts to guide.</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet when of all he was prepar’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Another hardship was declar’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">As they were ’bout to leave the land,</p>
<p class="verse0">Six weeks cess before the hand,</p>
<p class="verse0">They gave a charge for all to pay</p>
<p class="verse0">Who dealt into the malting way,</p>
<p class="verse0">Forthwith to raise this contribution</p>
<p class="verse0">On pain of military execution.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">This did the brewers exasp’rate,</p>
<p class="verse0">But to answer they knew not what.</p>
<p class="verse0">An honest quaker brew’d good ale,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who never wanted a ready tale,</p>
<p class="verse0">To him the brewers did apply,</p>
<p class="verse0">For his good counsel what to say:</p>
<p class="verse0">After that he had heard them speak,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Your speech, says he, does make me sick,</p>
<p class="verse0">“By Yea and Nay, I think it’s fit,</p>
<p class="verse0">“To keep our money and pay with wit,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Though he’s noble born, I do not lo’e him;</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">“Yet ne’ertheless I will go to him:</p>
<p class="verse0">“Were he all the earthly into one skin,</p>
<p class="verse0">“He’s but a lump of dust and sin,</p>
<p class="verse0">“If I regard the face of clay,</p>
<p class="verse0">“To morrow be my bury’ng day:</p>
<p class="verse0">“He’s fenc’d around with men and swords,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Which I’ll repel with simple words.”</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">This honest quaker took his way,</p>
<p class="verse0">And call’d for Charles without delay,</p>
<p class="verse0">I am a man who want to see him;</p>
<p class="verse0">Because I have some bus’ness wi’ him.</p>
<p class="verse0">Said one, You must tell that to me,</p>
<p class="verse0">By Yea and Nay, thou art not he,</p>
<p class="verse0">The tidings which I have to tell</p>
<p class="verse0">Concerneth none but Charles himsell,</p>
<p class="verse0">And if he’ll not permit me in,</p>
<p class="verse0">My mouth I’ll shut and not begin:</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Then at the door he entrance gat,</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet neither mov’d his hand or hat,</p>
<p class="verse0">Says&mdash;&mdash;“Charles, man what dost thou mean?</p>
<p class="verse0">“Thou sure are not this countries friend,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Thou’rt worse than all that came before thee,</p>
<p class="verse0">“And will make the country quite abhor thee,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Thou’rt worse than George for all his stents,</p>

<p class="verse0">“Thou car’st not whether we lose or win;</p>
<p class="verse0">“We may die, ere six weeks be past,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Look what thou do’st, run not too fast.”</p>
<p class="verse0">Charles replies, “a strait we’re on;</p>
<p class="verse0">“But ’gainst your wills, it sha’n’t be done.”</p>
<p class="verse0"><em>Then thank thee kindly for thy grant</em>,</p>

<p class="verse0">Having friends within and round about,</p>
<p class="verse0">Long to resist they seem’d unstout.</p>
<p class="verse0">The town and castle both they got</p>
<p class="verse0">Call’d England’s <span class="smcap">Key</span>, an useful spot.</p>
<p class="verse0">At Carlisle he did leave a band</p>
<p class="verse0">The town and fort for to command,</p>
<p class="verse0">From thence to Penrith did proceed,</p>
<p class="verse0">And then for Kendal march’d with speed:</p>
<p class="verse0">To Lancaster they came indeed,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which news put England in great dread;</p>
<p class="verse0">To Proud-preston and Manchester</p>
<p class="verse0">They still advanc’d withouten fear,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being join’d by none of English train,</p>
<p class="verse0">But five hundred Lancaster men,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which to him was of small effect;</p>
<p class="verse0">For hard marching made them to ake,</p>
<p class="verse0">And miss’d their dinner many a day,</p>
<p class="verse0">Made them, repenting, sigh and say</p>
<p class="verse0">“Woe worth the Scots; for they can feed</p>
<p class="verse0">“On drinking water and eating bread:</p>
<p class="verse0">“Their irony soles do never tire</p>
<p class="verse0">“On stony ground, dub or mire.</p>
<p class="verse0">“Beef or pudding they never mind:</p>
<p class="verse0">“Them Scots can live on <em>snuffing wind</em>,</p>

<p class="verse0">&mdash;&mdash; To such hard frets thus driven were</p>
<p class="verse0">Poor hungry Toms, of Lancashire:</p>
<p class="verse0">For in all haste they marched up,</p>
<p class="verse0">At Manchester they made a stop;</p>
<p class="verse0">Here his faithful Clans perceiv’d and saw,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">That English vows were nought at a’;</p>
<p class="verse0">Some kind enough; but no way friendly:</p>
<p class="verse0">Only through terror they acted meanly.</p>
<p class="verse0">Said the Scots Chiefs, “We blinded be,</p>
<p class="verse0">“That’s come far from our own countrie.</p>
<p class="verse0">“As friends, indeed, some English own us;</p>

<p class="verse0">“The Duke before and Wade behind,</p>
<p class="verse0">“And where now shelter can we find?”</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Then Charles, hearing all this, said,</p>
<p class="verse0">With heart full sore he answer made,</p>
<p class="verse0">“My Lords and Gentlemen (said he),</p>

<p class="verse0">“Our friends there would so well assist,</p>
<p class="verse0">“That en’mies were of small request.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">“That stalward Duke’s so fierce and keen,</p>

<p class="verse0">“Battle avoid we surely must,</p>
<p class="verse0">“I trust the French to come by sea;</p>
<p class="verse0">“But where can their invasion be?</p>
<p class="verse0">“If at sea indeed they have been check’d</p>
<p class="verse0">“It damps our hope; but does not wreck’t.</p>

<p class="verse2">Then proclaiming his father there,</p>

<p class="verse0">Where the Duke’s army lay ’fore him</p>
<p class="verse0">Well prepar’d for to devour him.</p>
<p class="verse0">He here to fight had no desire,</p>
<p class="verse0">Took east the muirs for Derbyshire,</p>

<p class="verse0">But there receiv’d intelligence,</p>
<p class="verse0">His friends to rise had now no chance,</p>

<p class="verse0">No assembling could be together,</p>
<p class="verse0">Nor word of French ships coming hither.</p>
<p class="verse0">The south coast all was guarded round,</p>
<p class="verse0">An English fleet cruis’d up and down;</p>

<p class="verse0">Militia swarm’d, like locust-bands.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">

<p class="verse0">Backward for Scotland then to flee.</p>
<p class="verse0">This did the vulgar sore chagreen,</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">When Cumberland perceived this,</p>

<p class="verse0">Wade on the north, was marching to him.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Duke behind, did still pursue him.</p>
<p class="verse0">One Oglethorpe upon his right,</p>
<p class="verse0">With a thousand hunters all in flight:</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet he, still his way did keep,</p>
<p class="verse0">Through Derby town and Ashburn peak:</p>
<p class="verse0">Which towns indeed for rash proceeding,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were badly paid for what was needing,</p>
<p class="verse0">When they perceived their flight was back,</p>
<p class="verse0">Quite contrary was their kind act,</p>
<p class="verse0">For all the praise they got before,</p>
<p class="verse0">They now were savages and more.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">December the fourth, they turn’d about,</p>
<p class="verse0">Out of England they took their rout,</p>
<p class="verse0">At Derby town they staid two nights,</p>
<p class="verse0">To get in superscription writes,</p>
<p class="verse0">Form’d by an English party there,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which made that town and country bare,</p>
<p class="verse0">And furnish, at an easy price,</p>
<p class="verse0">A vast of things for their supplies.</p>
<p class="verse0">When to Manchester back they came,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their usage there was much the same:</p>

<p class="verse0">Two thousand Sterling were made t’ pay,</p>
<p class="verse0">To save the plund’ring of the town;</p>
<p class="verse0">Paid when the kingdom was his own.</p>
<p class="verse0">So north they came to Wigan then,</p>
<p class="verse0">Next day they did Proud Preston gain.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Duke behind him but a day,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ride as they will he kept his way.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">And could not gain a mile upon ’em,</p>
<p class="verse0">Tho’ stout hors’d, they did outrun ’em.</p>
<p class="verse0">From Preston on the thirteenth day,</p>
<p class="verse0">Early at morn he march’d away.</p>
<p class="verse0">No sooner had they quit these towns,</p>
<p class="verse0">Than Oglethorpe with Wade’s dragoons</p>
<p class="verse0">Enter’d just at the other end,</p>
<p class="verse0">To give them chase they did intend;</p>
<p class="verse0">But being fatigu’d, chose rest a while.</p>
<p class="verse0">In three days they march’d a hundred mile,</p>
<p class="verse0">Through ice and hills cover’d with snow,</p>
<p class="verse0">Across Yorkshire as they did go,</p>
<p class="verse0">With full intent to intercept him</p>
<p class="verse0">And at Proud Preston thought to kep him,</p>
<p class="verse0">They had no footmen here, ’tis true,</p>
<p class="verse0">But royal hunters not a few,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who were so keen in battle rage,</p>
<p class="verse0">On foot they offer’d to engage,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being zealous youths of gentle fame,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who, by fighting thought to gain a name.</p>
<p class="verse0">And as they were to march again,</p>
<p class="verse0">A false alarm gave them pain,</p>
<p class="verse0">That French invaded had the south,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which passed for a certain truth:</p>
<p class="verse0">Such tidings from Duke William came,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who actually believ’d the same,</p>
<p class="verse0">And stopt his forces for a day,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till Charles was got out of the way.</p>
<p class="verse0">And Orders sent to Oglethorpe</p>
<p class="verse0">To come to him with all his troop:</p>
<p class="verse0">As soon as he the Duke had join’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">The news prov’d such as <em>Jacks</em> had coin’d.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then Oglethorpe he got command,</p>
<p class="verse0">To go in chace of Charlie’s band,</p>
<p class="verse0">And, if possible, get before him,</p>
<p class="verse0">While he behind would soon devour him.</p>
<p class="verse0">But, on the fifteenth, I understand,</p>
<p class="verse0">Charles reach’d Kendal in Westmoreland,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Now thinking that the chace was over,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Slacked his march; but did discover</p>
<p class="verse0">The English bloody flag behind,</p>
<p class="verse0">And colours waving in the wind.</p>
<p class="verse0">To range their rear they were not slow,</p>
<p class="verse0">But the front, of this they did not know.</p>
<p class="verse0">At the village Clifton, in Westmoreland,</p>
<p class="verse0">They prudently pitch’d out a stand,</p>
<p class="verse0">At a Quaker’s house stood near the way,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which rous’d his sp’rit ’bove Yea and Nay:</p>
<p class="verse0">Behind the hedges, walls and lones,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where unperceiv’d they stood as stones.</p>
<p class="verse0">The eighteenth day of dark December,</p>
<p class="verse0">In Forty Five, you’ll this remember,</p>
<p class="verse0">After the setting of the sun,</p>
<p class="verse0">Just as Black night was coming on,</p>
<p class="verse0">The King’s dragoons and Kingston’s horse</p>
<p class="verse0">Came prancing up, at unawares.</p>
<p class="verse0">A volley shot out thro’ the hedge,</p>
<p class="verse0">Full on their flank did them engage,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which in confusion did them throw,</p>
<p class="verse0">And through the hedge they could not go.</p>
<p class="verse0">Brave gen’ral Bland commanded here</p>
<p class="verse0">Who quickly caused his troops retire;</p>
<p class="verse0">For had they more such volleys got,</p>
<p class="verse0">Few had returned from the spot.</p>
<p class="verse0">Young Honeywood was wounded sore,</p>
<p class="verse0">The Duke, enrag’d, then highly swore</p>
<p class="verse0">That he’d revenged be that night,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or die before the morning light:</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet counsell’d was for to desist;</p>
<p class="verse0">For ambuscades were hard to trust,</p>
<p class="verse0">So the pursuit he did delay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till near about the break of day:</p>
<p class="verse0">Brave men and horse lay on the field,</p>
<p class="verse0">Tho’ both the sides did flee and yield:</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet this check Charles’ end did gain,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">For he that night wou’d been o’erta’en:</p>
<p class="verse0">Lord Elcho and Murray form’d that plan,</p>
<p class="verse0">And did the party here command,</p>
<p class="verse0">Not without loss, I truly say;</p>
<p class="verse0">On both sides dead and wounded lay.</p>
<p class="verse0">Few Highlanders did come to blows,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till thro’ the hedge some horsemen goes,</p>
<p class="verse0">And did engage with sword in hand;</p>
<p class="verse0">But made nought of it with the Clan,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who did come on in numbers thick,</p>
<p class="verse0">And horse and men did hough and prick.</p>
<p class="verse0">’Bout twenty five lay on the field,</p>
<p class="verse0">And thirty wounded fled for bield,</p>
<p class="verse0">With gen’ral Bland they rode away</p>
<p class="verse0">Toward the Duke, who heard the fray</p>
<p class="verse0">And came the battle to renew;</p>
<p class="verse0">But in the dark it would not do.</p>
<p class="verse0">Of Highlanders, as I heard say,</p>
<p class="verse0">But fourteen on the field there lay.</p>
<p class="verse0">George Hamilton of Stewart’s reg’ment,</p>
<p class="verse0">As prisoner he did consent,</p>
<p class="verse0">After a stout resistance made,</p>
<p class="verse0">And deeply wounded in the head,</p>
<p class="verse0">Cut by an Austrian Hussar,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who serv’d the Duke during this war.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then from the field they fled in haste,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to Penrith at midnight past,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where the main body was come before,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which spread the alarm more and more;</p>
<p class="verse0">Dreading th’ English did yet pursue,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then all out of the town they flew.</p>
<p class="verse0">Good for Penrith it happen’d so,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or next morn had been a day of woe:</p>
<p class="verse0">They vow’d in ashes it to lay</p>
<p class="verse0">For what they’d done the other day,</p>
<p class="verse0">To those who plunder’d Lowther-hall.</p>
<p class="verse0">And Penrith guards did on them fall,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Beat and broke them, and some slew,</p>
<p class="verse0">And some they into prison threw:</p>
<p class="verse0">The rest into Carlisle did run,</p>
<p class="verse0">As from that fortress they had come,</p>
<p class="verse0">The while that Charles was in the south,</p>
<p class="verse0">Wanting something to taste their mouth,</p>
<p class="verse0">A foraging they came about,</p>
<p class="verse0">Only a small band in a scout,</p>
<p class="verse0">And Penrith guards upon them fell</p>
<p class="verse0">So Charles by chance of it heard tell:</p>
<p class="verse0">Perth vow’d revenge, in dreadful ire,</p>
<p class="verse0">A recompense with sword and fire;</p>
<p class="verse0">But when such hurry on them came,</p>
<p class="verse0">They minded nought but up and ran.</p>
<p class="verse0">As one behind another did stand,</p>
<p class="verse0">He cries, <em>Furich tere be Cumberland</em>.</p>
<p class="verse0">Dark was the night and rough the way,</p>
<p class="verse0">Carlisle they reach’d by break of day:</p>
<p class="verse0">There’s sixteen miles between these towns,</p>
<p class="verse0">But the weak and weari’d, left in wounds,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were all catched on the next day,</p>
<p class="verse0">By their fierce foes coming that way,</p>
<p class="verse0">About an hundred men or more,</p>
<p class="verse0">And badly us’d you may be sure.</p>
<p class="verse0">Being into loathsome jails confin’d</p>
<p class="verse0">But poorly kept and badly din’d.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">The Duke to Penrith came next day,</p>
<p class="verse0">On the twentieth at Hasket lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being then within twelve short mile</p>
<p class="verse0">Of the strong fortress of Carlisle.</p>
<p class="verse0">And hearing the Scots were safely there,</p>
<p class="verse0">To follow hard he took no care:</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon his rear thought fit to rest,</p>
<p class="verse0">And counsel call’d to do what’s best.</p>
<p class="verse0">On the twenty-second they marched on</p>
<p class="verse0">But finding that the Scots were gone,</p>
<p class="verse0">All but a few who did pretend,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">The town and castle to defend.</p>
<p class="verse0">Who there were left, I understan’,</p>
<p class="verse0">By sole advice of Sullivan,</p>

<p class="verse0">For Irishmen are soldiers good,</p>

<p class="verse0">Abroad or yet in native land.</p>
<p class="verse0">This Sullivan he did pretend,</p>

<p class="verse0">That they should come no further north</p>
<p class="verse0">Till Scots had join’d their friends on Forth.</p>
<p class="verse0">And Hamilton from Aberdeen</p>
<p class="verse0">To guard the place appear’d so keen;</p>
<p class="verse0">Had they stood on but for a day,</p>
<p class="verse0">As open to the north it lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which was Perth, Murray and Elcho’s plan,</p>

<p class="verse0">Very strong gates and stately walls:</p>

<p class="verse0">Lancashire reg’ment chus’d there to ’bide,</p>

<p class="verse0">The English gate of iron and oak,</p>

<p class="verse0">By the Langtown on Esk’s side,</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">December, on the twenty-two,</p>
<p class="verse0">The English round Carlisle they drew,</p>
<p class="verse0">On south west side fix’d on a place</p>
<p class="verse0">Which opposite the castle was.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Duke all round it took a view,</p>
<p class="verse0">And of the castle had no brow,</p>
<p class="verse0">It seem’d to him like a dung hill,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or like a German old brick kiln:</p>
<p class="verse0">But yet their cannon play’d right smart,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which caus’d them from the hills depart.</p>
<p class="verse0">To capit’late the terms they crav’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were, <em>T’ march with honour away to leav’t</em>.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">The Duke reply’d, “That is a due</p>
<p class="verse0">“Ne’er given to any rebel crew;</p>
<p class="verse0">“But ne’ertheless take it I shall,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Either with honour or not at all.”</p>
<p class="verse0">Then in the dark time of the night,</p>
<p class="verse0">He caus’d lay down, to cloud their sight,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Loads of straw and ricks of hay;</p>
<p class="verse0">There dig’d a trench of turf and clay:</p>
<p class="verse0">But batt’ring cannon he had none,</p>
<p class="verse0">But small field guns to mount thereon;</p>
<p class="verse0">Till from Whitehav’n, thirty miles away,</p>
<p class="verse0">Drove heavy cannon on it to lay.</p>
<p class="verse0">As soon as they began to fire,</p>
<p class="verse0">They beat the walls as low as mire,</p>
<p class="verse0">And made a breach both broad and wide,</p>
<p class="verse0">In the castle wall on the west side;</p>
<p class="verse0">To enter there, began to form,</p>
<p class="verse0">And take the fort by bloody storm.</p>
<p class="verse0">No quarters they propos’d to give,</p>
<p class="verse0">Put all to death, not one to live;</p>
<p class="verse0">When this they saw, without all doubt,</p>
<p class="verse0">A flag of mercy they hung out;</p>
<p class="verse0">But all that could obtained be,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was pris’ners at the King’s mercy.</p>
<p class="verse0">From thence they were to London sent,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where heads and hearts were from them rent</p>
<p class="verse0">Some executed in that place,</p>
<p class="verse0">And members dash’d into their face,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their very hearts cut out alive,</p>
<p class="verse0">Such butch’ry’s horrid to descrive.</p>
<p class="verse0">Many of the commons banish’d were</p>
<p class="verse0">To plantations, I know not where,</p>
<p class="verse0">John Hamilton the governor,</p>
<p class="verse0">His head, from off his body shore,</p>
<p class="verse0">Fix’d on a pole on the Scots-port,</p>
<p class="verse0">Scots for the future to exhort,</p>
<p class="verse0">By viewing the spectacles were there,</p>
<p class="verse0">Against rebellion to have a care.</p>
<p class="verse0">Two Lancashire men’s heads also,</p>
<p class="verse0">On th’ English gate fixt as a show,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whom they did English rebels call,</p>
<p class="verse0">A proof Scots are not rebels all;</p>
<p class="verse0">I only show there’s part of both,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">And for their fate, I say, “Oh, hogh!”</p>
<p class="verse0">A dreadful sight for human eyes,</p>
<p class="verse0">For to behold such sacrifice</p>
<p class="verse0">’Mong Christian people, as I think,</p>
<p class="verse0">At what I’ve seen my heart does shrink;</p>
<p class="verse0">When I view the place and on it ponder,</p>
<p class="verse0">The bloody butch’ry that’s been yonder,</p>
<p class="verse0">I mean in the streets of Carlisle,</p>
<p class="verse0">The mangling that was there a while.</p>
<p class="verse0">Of such like acts I’ll say no more,</p>
<p class="verse0">But follow the subject just before.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">The Duke forthwith to London went,</p>
<p class="verse0">And gen’ral Hawly to Scotland sent,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who round by Berwick took his rout,</p>
<p class="verse0">Near a full hundred miles about,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ev’n by Newcastle and Dunbar,</p>
<p class="verse0">It must be own’d the stretch was far,</p>
<p class="verse0">Before he came to E’nburgh town</p>
<p class="verse0">Fatigu’d were both foot and dragoon.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">While Charles did through England pass,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lord Loudon lay at Inverness,</p>
<p class="verse0">And with him did two thousand men</p>
<p class="verse0">To keep in awe the Highland Clan:</p>
<p class="verse0">For several lairds their Clans did raise,</p>
<p class="verse0">And some took part in both the ways;</p>
<p class="verse0">Others kept them in their own bounds,</p>
<p class="verse0">For preservation of their grounds,</p>
<p class="verse0">And when Duke William gain’d the day,</p>
<p class="verse0">It was for him, they then did say;</p>
<p class="verse0">But if Charles had chanc’d to prevail</p>
<p class="verse0">Some think they’d told another tale.</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet Loudon to King George was true,</p>
<p class="verse0">And by his conduct did subdue</p>
<p class="verse0">Many who were as foes inclin’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">And kept them in a neutral mind.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Frazers’ clan he drove away,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who around Fort Augustus lay,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Commanded by lord Lovat’s son,</p>
<p class="verse0">He made them from that fort to run.</p>
<p class="verse0">Lord Lewis Gordon lay from him south,</p>
<p class="verse0">With lord John Drummond, a furious youth,</p>
<p class="verse0">And brother to the Duke of Perth,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who wish’d Loudon sent off the earth,</p>
<p class="verse0">And under their command, it seems,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was the French Regiment de Fitz James,</p>
<p class="verse0">With Clan’s rais’d on the northern shore,</p>
<p class="verse0">About three thousand men or more,</p>
<p class="verse0">Kept Aberdeen, Perth, and Dundee,</p>
<p class="verse0">And all the low towns by the sea:</p>
<p class="verse0">The fierce MacLeod lay west from them,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who on George’s side had rais’d his men,</p>
<p class="verse0">Intending to take Aberdeen,</p>
<p class="verse0">Knowing that Gordon lay therein,</p>
<p class="verse0">He as far as Inverurie came,</p>
<p class="verse0">In hopes next day to reach the same;</p>
<p class="verse0">But Gordon of this was aware,</p>
<p class="verse0">And for to meet him did prepare,</p>
<p class="verse0">But march’d his men another way,</p>
<p class="verse0">As tho’ he would not on him stay.</p>
<p class="verse0">West from the road he took his rout,</p>
<p class="verse0">Altho’ it was some miles about,</p>
<p class="verse0">Kept hollow ways not to be seen,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where woods and planting did him screen,</p>
<p class="verse0">And ’bout the setting of the sun,</p>
<p class="verse0">He spy’d them entering the town.</p>
<p class="verse0">A halt he made, judg’d what to do,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of’s being there they nothing knew.</p>
<p class="verse0">Much like his own their number seem’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then for to fight, it best he deem’d:</p>
<p class="verse0">And what favour’d his notion more,</p>
<p class="verse0">He saw them billoting, a score</p>
<p class="verse0">Or more into each country town,</p>
<p class="verse0">At two miles distance all around.</p>
<p class="verse0">When the full half of them were gone,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">He thought it time to draw them on,</p>
<p class="verse0">In full brigade at the town’s end,</p>
<p class="verse0">Before MacLeod ought of him <em>kend</em>:</p>
<p class="verse0">The first intelligence some got</p>
<p class="verse0">Was by the rattling of the shot.</p>
<p class="verse0">Confus’d he was in this sad case</p>
<p class="verse0">His men dispers’d, and few to face.</p>
<p class="verse0">The foes assault, upon the hill</p>
<p class="verse0">He rallied them near to the mill.</p>
<p class="verse0">They fir’d full brisk on every side;</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet Gordon’s force was hard to <em>bide</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">They being to arms bred in France,</p>
<p class="verse0">Knew how to retreat, and to advance.</p>
<p class="verse0">MacLeod’s men, in number few,</p>
<p class="verse0">Quite raw and undisciplin’d too,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lost nearly twenty upon the spot,</p>
<p class="verse0">And forty fled gall’d by the shot.</p>
<p class="verse0">The laird himself, to end the matter,</p>
<p class="verse0">Did fly and could not make it better.</p>
<p class="verse0">His men in crowds came running in,</p>
<p class="verse0">Crying, <em>Master did ye loss or win?</em></p>
<p class="verse0">But for to rally in such a <em>stour</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">He had no time, might, or power;</p>
<p class="verse0">The darksome night was coming on,</p>
<p class="verse0">And his best men lay dead and gone,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or wounded, they before him fled:</p>
<p class="verse0">While Gordon brisk advancing made,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whose loss that night was not heard tell,</p>
<p class="verse0">Alledging that none of them fell;</p>
<p class="verse0">He gained the field and town, ’tis true,</p>
<p class="verse0">But yet ’twas judg’d he lost a few,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whom they did bury in the night,</p>
<p class="verse0">To keep their losses out of sight.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">This bloody battle, as they say,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was fought the night before <em>Yuil</em> day,</p>
<p class="verse0">At the end of Inverurie town,</p>
<p class="verse0">Led on by Gordon and Drummond,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Against MacLeod and all his Clan,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who did not well concert the plan:</p>
<p class="verse0">Spreading his men so far a <em>breed</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was nothing like a martial deed:</p>
<p class="verse0">For the one half they overthrew,</p>
<p class="verse0">Before the other ought on’t knew.</p>
<p class="verse0">It was a trick of war ye <em>ken</em></p>
<p class="verse0">For making them more wise again;</p>
<p class="verse0">No sooner Gordon got the town,</p>
<p class="verse0">Than centries plac’d were all aroun’,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who kept patrolling through the night,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lest MacLeod shou’d renew the fight;</p>
<p class="verse0">But to the hills he did proceed,</p>
<p class="verse0">There to bewail his luckless deed.</p>
<p class="verse0">Gordon return’d to Aberdeen</p>
<p class="verse0">Rejoicing he’d victorious been,</p>
<p class="verse0">From thence to Stirling got his rout,</p>
<p class="verse0">To join his Prince when thereabout.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">When from Dumfries they came away,</p>
<p class="verse0">Hamilton they reach’d on the next day;</p>
<p class="verse0">Knowing no danger then before them,</p>
<p class="verse0">They levied all things fit to store them,</p>
<p class="verse0">As horse, of which they had great need,</p>
<p class="verse0">Many of them being rode to dead.</p>
<p class="verse0">Of meat and drink they spier’d no price;</p>
<p class="verse0">But little harm did otherwise,</p>
<p class="verse0">Save changing shoes when brogues were spent,</p>
<p class="verse0">For victuals sure they could not want.</p>
<p class="verse0">To Glasgow they came the next day,</p>
<p class="verse0">In a very poor forlorn way,</p>
<p class="verse0">The shot was rusted in the gun,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their swords from scabbards would not twin,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their count’nance fierce as a wild bear,</p>
<p class="verse0">Out o’er their eyes hang down their hair,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their very thighs red tanned quite;</p>
<p class="verse0">But yet as nimble as they’d been white;</p>
<p class="verse0">Their beards were turned black and brown,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">The like was ne’er seen in that town,</p>
<p class="verse0">Some of them did barefooted run,</p>
<p class="verse0">Minded no mire nor stony groun’;</p>
<p class="verse0">But when shav’n, drest and cloth’d again</p>
<p class="verse0">They turn’d to be like other men.</p>
<p class="verse0">Eight days they did in Glasgow rest,</p>
<p class="verse0">Until they were all cloth’d and drest:</p>
<p class="verse0">And though they on the best o’t fed,</p>
<p class="verse0">The town they under tribute laid,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ten thousand Sterling made it pay,</p>
<p class="verse0">For being of the Georgian way,</p>
<p class="verse0">Given in goods and ready cash,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or else to stand a plundering lash:</p>
<p class="verse0">And ’cause they did Militia raise,</p>
<p class="verse0">They were esteem’d as mortal faes:</p>
<p class="verse0">For being oppos’d to <em>Jacobites</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">They plainly call’d them <em>Whiggonites</em>.</p>
<p class="verse0">But, for peace sake, to get them clear,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of ev’ry thing they furnish’d were,</p>
<p class="verse0">A printing Press and two workmen</p>
<p class="verse0">To print their journals as they ran.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">From Glasgow then they took their rout,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lochiel he led his Clan about</p>
<p class="verse0">By Cumbernauld, another way,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lest Kir’ntilloch they should repay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which had killed two of their Clan,</p>
<p class="verse0">That a spulzieing unto it came;</p>
<p class="verse0">As they were passing through the town,</p>
<p class="verse0">They by the rabble were knock’d down,</p>
<p class="verse0">For which the place was taxed sore,</p>
<p class="verse0">And dreaden much ’twould suffer more.</p>
<p class="verse0">Near Stirling then, they all did meet,</p>
<p class="verse0">Summon’d the town for to submit,</p>
<p class="verse0">Militia therein were quartered,</p>
<p class="verse0">And the townsmen also, armed,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who did defend a day or two;</p>
<p class="verse0">But found their force it would not do:</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Though a good wall both stout and strong,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lay on the south where they came on;</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet ’tween the water and the town</p>
<p class="verse0">It lay quite open, halfway roun’.</p>
<p class="verse0">The bridge was cut on the south side,</p>
<p class="verse0">The water deep they could not wade;</p>
<p class="verse0">Their nearest pass was at the Frew,</p>
<p class="verse0">Full four miles west and in their view.</p>
<p class="verse0">Four thousand lay on the north side,</p>
<p class="verse0">Threat’ning the town whate’er betide.</p>
<p class="verse0">Glasgow Militia had left the place,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to met Hawley at Ed’nbro’ was.</p>
<p class="verse0">Militia they had; but not enew,</p>
<p class="verse0">Such duty was too hard to do.</p>
<p class="verse0">Those who did ly on the north hand,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were not of those were in England;</p>
<p class="verse0">But with Lord Lewis Gordon came,</p>
<p class="verse0">Brother to th’ Duke of that same name,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which he had raised in the north,</p>
<p class="verse0">Help’d by lord John, brother to Perth,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who did command Fitz-James’s horse,</p>
<p class="verse0">That came from France into Montrose:</p>
<p class="verse0">Most of their riders Irish and Scots,</p>
<p class="verse0">Nat’rally bent to join such plots,</p>
<p class="verse0">Inclin’d to love the Stewart race,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whose fathers did that side embrace.</p>
<p class="verse0">These foresaid Lords most active were,</p>
<p class="verse0">Both men and money to prepare,</p>
<p class="verse0">And would have rais’d some thousands more,</p>
<p class="verse0">Had but six thousand French came o’er,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which, time from time, they promised;</p>
<p class="verse0">But the seas were too well guarded.</p>
<p class="verse0">Lord Loudon lay into the north,</p>
<p class="verse0">Long way beyond the Murray firth,</p>
<p class="verse0">Twenty sev’n hundred men had he,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which made the Frazer’s Clan to flee,</p>
<p class="verse0">When Fort Augustus they did besiege;</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Yet in open field would not engage.</p>
<p class="verse0">Likewise MacLeods, Grants and Munroes,</p>
<p class="verse0">Against the Stewarts in arms rose:</p>
<p class="verse0">The Sutherlands and name of Gun,</p>
<p class="verse0">To arms did against them run.</p>
<p class="verse0">Sir Duncan Forbes, Lord president,</p>
<p class="verse0">Caus’d many rise by his consent.</p>
<p class="verse0">Thus, in the north, I you assure,</p>
<p class="verse0">There was an army of great pow’r,</p>
<p class="verse0">All upon the Georgian side,</p>
<p class="verse0">Beside what was besouth the Clyde,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who all in arms there did unite,</p>
<p class="verse0">Unto the cause with noble sp’rit.</p>
<p class="verse0">Also the brave men of Argyle,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who were preparing all the while;</p>
<p class="verse0">But could not find safe passage east,</p>
<p class="verse0">Until they were from Glasgow past:</p>
<p class="verse0">And then they went by Airdrie town,</p>
<p class="verse0">When Hawley was through Lothian come,</p>
<p class="verse0">Him join’d at Ed’nburgh where they lay</p>
<p class="verse0">Preparing for the battle day;</p>
<p class="verse0">Glasgow and Paisley troops were there,</p>

<p class="verse0">No time had they for to provide,</p>
<p class="verse0">Charles being so long on their south side.</p>
<p class="verse0">Their ammunition too was small,</p>
<p class="verse0">No stock of powder, nor yet of ball;</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet all encouragement he gave</p>
<p class="verse0">To those who’d help the Fort to save:</p>
<p class="verse0">His endeavours he spared not</p>
<p class="verse0">To find such stores as could be got:</p>
<p class="verse0">And all he thought of use to be,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were welcome to his companie:</p>
<p class="verse0">And those who fearful were to stay</p>
<p class="verse0">Freely got leave to go away;</p>
<p class="verse0">Th’ unloyal he charg’d not to ’tend it;</p>
<p class="verse0">For to the last he would defend it.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Summons he got for to surrender;</p>
<p class="verse0">But answer made, “He was defender,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Intrusted by king George command,</p>
<p class="verse0">“To which, he vow’d, he’d firmly stand.”</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Then to assault they did prepare,</p>
<p class="verse0">Milit’ry engines erected there,</p>
<p class="verse0">Cannon from th’ other side the Forth,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which had been landed in the north.</p>
<p class="verse0">British cannons lost at Fount’noy,</p>
<p class="verse0">Came home this Fort for to destroy.</p>
<p class="verse0">To raise a trench, in haste they got,</p>
<p class="verse0">As near the walls as pistol shot,</p>
<p class="verse0">On the east side, on a hill top,</p>
<p class="verse0">To breach the wall it was their hope:</p>
<p class="verse0">And then by storm they did pretend,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of all within to make an end:</p>
<p class="verse0">But at this instant Hawley came,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which put a stop to their fierce aim.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Then all their force together drew,</p>
<p class="verse0">Those in the north past at the Frew;</p>
<p class="verse0">Near by Torwood they rendezvouz’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where Hawley’s camp, afar they view’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Hard by Falkirk, on the north side,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">The English banners were display’d.</p>
<p class="verse0">From th’ banks of Carron they had in view,</p>
<p class="verse0">All passes where they could come thro’:</p>

<p class="verse0">But high presumption their courage fills,</p>

<p class="verse0">The rebel Scots would not them face:</p>
<p class="verse0">And as in scorn did them deride,</p>
<p class="verse0">So to advance did slow proceed:</p>
<p class="verse0">And spent their time in vain delay</p>
<p class="verse0">Ev’n the forepart of th’ battle-day.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">While Charlie, with much active care,</p>

<p class="verse2">Then with fury began the siege,</p>
<p class="verse0">Both day and night they did engage:</p>
<p class="verse0">On the east side upon a height,</p>
<p class="verse0">Open’d a batt’ry in the night,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of wooden faggots fill’d with mud:</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon a rock the trench it stood,</p>
<p class="verse0">To dig it deep it would not do,</p>
<p class="verse0">At last they purchas’d packs of woo,</p>
<p class="verse0">For which Perth’s duke gave his own bill,</p>
<p class="verse0">Smith may protest it when he will,</p>
<p class="verse0">For Perth and Blackney both are gone,</p>
<p class="verse0">And I trow, it was paid by none.</p>
<p class="verse0">The country ’round they did compel</p>
<p class="verse0">Faggots to make and trees to fell.</p>
<p class="verse0">The one built up, th’ other beat down,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their noise was heard the country round.</p>
<p class="verse0">Indeed <em>hersel</em> was loth to do it;</p>
<p class="verse0">But on pain of death <em>she</em> was put to’t.</p>
<p class="verse0">French engineers indeed they had,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who order’d all to work like mad.</p>
<p class="verse0">Here many a poor man lost his life,</p>

<p class="verse0">These engineers, who knew far better,</p>
<p class="verse0">Out of their lives did still them flatter,</p>
<p class="verse0">At ev’ry point where danger was</p>
<p class="verse0">They made the poor unthoughtfu’ pass:</p>
<p class="verse0">Which only did prolong the time,</p>
<p class="verse0">To murder men they thought no crime:</p>
<p class="verse0">For well they knew it would not do,</p>
<p class="verse0">With such batt’ries of mud and woo:</p>
<p class="verse0">Unless they made a cover’d way</p>
<p class="verse0">Dug in the earth, thro’ sand or clay.</p>
<p class="verse0">Ten days they wrought with all their pow’r,</p>
<p class="verse0">And men they lost on’t ev’ry hour,</p>
<p class="verse0">Night and day there was no rest,</p>
<p class="verse0">And Blackney always had the best.</p>
<p class="verse0">The fort being high above their trench,</p>
<p class="verse0">To see their work it was no pinch,</p>
<p class="verse0">Dung hill like on a rock ’twas laid:</p>
<p class="verse0">In form of a potatoe-bed.</p>
<p class="verse0">With tow and tar when it was dark</p>
<p class="verse0">He let them see to do their wark,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which as a lamp burnt on their trench,</p>
<p class="verse0">Caus’d many die who thought to quench’t.</p>
<p class="verse0">They skirmish’d on, both night and day,</p>
<p class="verse0">With cannons and small arms did play:</p>
<p class="verse0">Four big guns were brought up at last;</p>
<p class="verse0">But soon were off their carriage cast,</p>

<p class="verse0">Of cannon balls they had but few,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which caus’d them fire with coals and stones,</p>

<p class="verse0">Unless to give some hearty <em>fairing</em>.</p>
<p class="verse0">An engineer who plagu’d him sadly,</p>

<p class="verse0">By his upbraiding speech and mocks,</p>
<p class="verse0">As he’d been more than other folks,</p>
<p class="verse0">Some did believe he had a charm,</p>
<p class="verse0">As ’gainst a shot he’d wag his arm,</p>
<p class="verse0">Fife try’d with ball, iron and stones,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then curs’d his <em>cantraips</em> skin and bones;</p>
<p class="verse0">He was some de’il as all did miss him,</p>
<p class="verse0">Said he, I’ll find a way to bless him,</p>
<p class="verse0">Having drunk some beer, bottles were by,</p>

<p class="verse0">“I trust, with this, to pierce thy skin,”</p>
<p class="verse0">Then play’d it off with all his art,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which minch’d him quite above the heart,</p>
<p class="verse0">So down he fell, spoke never more;</p>
<p class="verse0">Soon after this the siege gave o’er.</p>
<p class="verse0">The cannons all off carriage driven</p>
<p class="verse0">And trenches with the rocks made ev’n.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then to all those who went to see,</p>
<p class="verse0">Like potatoe field it seem’d to be.</p>
<p class="verse0">Many dead bodies in’t were found,</p>
<p class="verse0">White noses sticking thro’ the ground.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">All being o’er, since it began,</p>
<p class="verse0">Brave Blackney lost only one man;</p>
<p class="verse0">Six were wounded, ’tis very true;</p>

<p class="verse0">Recompence, equal to his merit;</p>
<p class="verse0">For which the poor lad broke his spirit,</p>

<p class="verse2">Now, to ev’ry body, ’tis a wonder,</p>

<p class="verse0">For between Falkirk and Kippen ay</p>
<p class="verse0">It is but sixteen miles of way,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which space maintain’d ten thousand more</p>
<p class="verse0">Than th’ usual number within each door,</p>
<p class="verse0">For full four weeks, or nearly thereby,</p>
<p class="verse0">The time they at the siege did ly,</p>
<p class="verse0">The happy Janet kept the Forth,</p>
<p class="verse0">And curb’d all vessels from the north.</p>
<p class="verse0">About the Queens-ferry she lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Came with the tides, and gave them play</p>
<p class="verse0">Up by Airth and Higgins nook,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where was a batt’ry prov’d a mock.</p>
<p class="verse0">They thought to keep Forth to themsel;</p>
<p class="verse0">But what it cost there’s few can tell:</p>
<p class="verse0">For all th’ shipping they had at sea,</p>
<p class="verse0">Did not exceed in number three,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which kept about Perth and Montrose,</p>
<p class="verse0">And privily to France did cross.</p>
<p class="verse0">So all round Stirling where they lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Oft did they wish they were away.</p>
<p class="verse0">Commands they sent all round about,</p>
<p class="verse0">And searched all provisions out.</p>
<p class="verse0">Some of them paid like honest men,</p>
<p class="verse0">Others did not, I tell you plain:</p>

<p class="verse0">By <em>crowdie</em> of her meal and <em>kirn</em>:</p>

<p class="verse0"><em>Guidwife cum sup here an ye please</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">I own indeed it was a failing;</p>

<p class="verse0">“Bound to a Popish ordinance.</p>
<p class="verse0">“I know there’s many of you here</p>
<p class="verse0">“Who’ve shown your merit, that I can swear,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Others, perhaps, n’er had occasion</p>
<p class="verse0">“To show your valour in foreign nation,</p>

<p class="verse0">Part of the Highland troops were there,</p>

<p class="verse0">Their cannon and baggage, all forsaken,</p>

<p class="verse0">Their magazine of powder and ball,</p>
<p class="verse0">Falkirk plunder, tents and all,</p>

<p class="verse0">An engineer enter’d the porch,</p>

<p class="verse0">He broke one barrel, as they say,</p>

<p class="verse0">Without the threshold of the door.</p>
<p class="verse0">Some people in the kirk there was,</p>
<p class="verse0">The love of plunder was the cause,</p>
<p class="verse0">The engineer backward did run,</p>
<p class="verse0">And at the powder fir’d his gun,</p>
<p class="verse0">Himself he thought quite secure too;</p>
<p class="verse0">But to the air with it he flew.</p>
<p class="verse0">Other eight persons there was slain,</p>

<p class="center"><em>The Duke’s arrival at Stirling. The Rebels’ Retreat, and
the Rout both Armies took to the North.</em></p>


<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Soon after William to Stirling came,</p>
<p class="verse0">With all his troops, a warlike ban’:</p>
<p class="verse0">Reg’ments of foot, there were fourteen,</p>
<p class="verse0">Sixteen field pieces of brass, full clean:</p>
<p class="verse0">Kingston’s, Cobham’s, and Ker’s dragoons.</p>
<p class="verse0">The trusty Campbells, all chosen ones,</p>
<p class="verse0">With Hawley, Husk, and John Mordaunt,</p>
<p class="verse0">Brave Ligonier he could not want,</p>
<p class="verse0">With Cholmondely, bred soldiers all,</p>
<p class="verse0">For battle ready at any call.</p>
<p class="verse0">One day his march was here suspended,</p>
<p class="verse0">The broken bridge for to get mended,</p>
<p class="verse0">O’er which the foot were safely past,</p>
<p class="verse0">And all the carriages at last.</p>
<p class="verse0">The horsemen forded Forth at Drip,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then to Dumblain they marched up.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">While the army into Stirling lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">They catched one they call’d a spy,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whom Hawley, by some uncouth laws,</p>
<p class="verse0">Condemn’d for carrying Charles’ pass,</p>
<p class="verse0">Likewise another from the Duke,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which made him more like traitor look,</p>
<p class="verse0">Hawley seiz’d them, and with an oath</p>
<p class="verse0">Swore he should be depriv’d of both:</p>
<p class="verse0">Go, said he, and get a rope,</p>
<p class="verse0">And take the dog and hing him up,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which was no sooner said than done,</p>
<p class="verse0">As soon’s the hangman could be foun’,</p>
<p class="verse0">Without confession, or clergy’s stamp,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was like a dog hung to a lamp.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Next day the duke went to Dumblane,</p>
<p class="verse0">Campbells’ and th’ horse had Crief reta’en.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Here the Highlanders did divide,</p>
<p class="verse0">Some took the hills, some water-side;</p>
<p class="verse0">The highland road by bridge of Tay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or by Dundee, the sea-side way,</p>
<p class="verse0">The horse and French brigades did chuse;</p>
<p class="verse0">And the Highland roads did refuse,</p>
<p class="verse0">So kept their rout north by Montrose,</p>
<p class="verse0">While th’ others climb’d o’er hills and moss:</p>
<p class="verse0">Short time they took in Perth to tarry,</p>
<p class="verse0">All the stores they could not carry,</p>
<p class="verse0">They threw into the river Tay,</p>
<p class="verse0">With cannon they could not take ’way,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thirteen of iron they spiked up,</p>
<p class="verse0">And swivels of the Hazard sloop,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which was taken off John’s haven,</p>
<p class="verse0">By help of that town’s fisher-men.</p>
<p class="verse0">Argyle Militia and the horse</p>
<p class="verse0">To Perth straight came; but did not cross</p>
<p class="verse0">The river Tay for to pursue,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till the whole army came in view.</p>
<p class="verse0">Some would have a party take the hill,</p>
<p class="verse0">But to this the Duke deny’d his will,</p>
<p class="verse0">And kept his march down by Dundee,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thro’ towns that lay hard by the sea</p>
<p class="verse0">Toward the town called Montrose,</p>
<p class="verse0">And great resentment there he shows:</p>
<p class="verse0">All the suspect’ did apprehend,</p>
<p class="verse0">And south to Stirling did them send,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where they’re detain’d close prisoner,</p>
<p class="verse0">’Till ’bout the ending of the stir;</p>
<p class="verse0">Many of them were innocent,</p>
<p class="verse0">As afterwards was truly <em>kent</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">If ’twas not for their thought and wish:</p>
<p class="verse0">For few durst say whose man he was</p>
<p class="verse0">Who lived into such a clime,</p>
<p class="verse0">And in such a critical time.</p>
<p class="verse0">Thence he unto John’s-haven sent,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">As being upon vengeance bent</p>
<p class="verse0">For taking of the Hazard sloop,</p>
<p class="verse0">And burnt their boats both <em>stoop and roop</em>.</p>
<p class="verse0">Two off’cers here he also broke,</p>
<p class="verse0">For their goodwill to Charlie’s folk,</p>
<p class="verse0">The one’s sash was in pieces cut,</p>
<p class="verse0">And quite out of the army put,</p>
<p class="verse0">His sword was broke above his head;</p>
<p class="verse0">Because he unto Charlie fled.</p>
<p class="verse0">The other, because he stopt the plunder</p>
<p class="verse0">Of th’ house of Gask, being sent under</p>
<p class="verse0">Strict command, to do such duty;</p>
<p class="verse0">But kept his party from the booty,</p>
<p class="verse0">For which he got’s commission torn,</p>
<p class="verse0">Himself depos’d with shame and scorn.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">From thence they march’d to Aberdeen,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where a storm of snow and frost full <em>keen</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which on the mountains some time lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Caus’d them into that town to stay.</p>
<p class="verse0">Hesse’s band in Perth then quarter’d was,</p>
<p class="verse0">And at Dunkeld keeped the pass,</p>
<p class="verse0">The remains of Gardner’s broke dragoons</p>
<p class="verse0">Kept Blair in Athole, and such towns:</p>
<p class="verse0">These horsemen twice had suffer’d sore,</p>
<p class="verse0">Here, by surprise, they suffer’d more:</p>
<p class="verse0">As they next to the Highlands lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">They <em>skelped</em> at them night and day.</p>
<p class="verse0">Being station’d in this utmost pass,</p>
<p class="verse0">They bore the <em>brunt</em> of all distress;</p>
<p class="verse0">But the Hessians kept about Dunkeld,</p>
<p class="verse0">And did into more safety dwell.</p>
<p class="verse0">These Hessians were a warlike band,</p>
<p class="verse0">Six thousand did their prince command,</p>
<p class="verse0">Earl Crawford in their company,</p>
<p class="verse0">To guide them thro’ the Scots country.</p>
<p class="verse0">Their countenance was awful fierce,</p>
<p class="verse0">They spake High-Dutch, or German Earse,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Had white buff-belts, and all blue clothes,</p>
<p class="verse0">With a long beard beneath their nose,</p>
<p class="verse0">And those who were in wedlock state,</p>
<p class="verse0">Had all long whiskers, like the cat.</p>
<p class="verse0">Their spatterdashes with pick were gilt,</p>
<p class="verse0">And long swords with a brazen hilt,</p>
<p class="verse0">Bars on the outside of the hand,</p>
<p class="verse0">And in their guns an iron wand.</p>
<p class="verse0">The finest music e’er you did hear</p>
<p class="verse0">Would make one dance who could not stir,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their whistles and drums in chorus join</p>
<p class="verse0">Did cheer one’s heart, they played so fine:</p>
<p class="verse0">Their grenadier’s had caps of brass,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thus order’d were the men of Hesse,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who camp’d for some time near Dunkeld,</p>
<p class="verse0">And kept that pass, till they hear’d tell</p>
<p class="verse0">How at Culloden all were broke,</p>
<p class="verse0">And they had never fought a stroke,</p>
<p class="verse0">Except one canonading bout;</p>
<p class="verse0">The clans afar came on a scout</p>
<p class="verse0">To view their camp from a hill top</p>
<p class="verse0">Who soon retir’d when they drew up:</p>
<p class="verse0">Whene’er their cannon began to play,</p>
<p class="verse0">They skipt like rams and ran away,</p>
<p class="verse0">Describ’d the Hessians ev’n as they can,</p>
<p class="verse0">Said, “He was a blue and bloody man,</p>
<p class="verse0">“His drums and guns pe ready, <em>got</em></p>
<p class="verse0">“Hersell pe rin, or else be shot.”</p>

<p class="verse2">Next Col’nel Stuart of Charlie’s band,</p>
<p class="verse0">At Strathbogie he did command</p>
<p class="verse0">One thousand foot, beside Hussars,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who kept that country round as theirs:</p>
<p class="verse0">Against him were sent on command</p>
<p class="verse0">The generals Moredant and Bland;</p>
<p class="verse0">But to Stra’bogie as they drew near,</p>
<p class="verse0">Stuart did unto Keith retire.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then captain Holden with volunteers</p>
<p class="verse0">Follow’d in chase, as it appears,</p>
<p class="verse0">Seventy Campbells by Bland were sent,</p>
<p class="verse0">And thirty Kingston’s horse too went,</p>
<p class="verse0">To clear the village of Keith while light,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to Stra’bogie return that night:</p>
<p class="verse0">But their presumption ran so high,</p>
<p class="verse0">They ventur’d there that night to lye,</p>
<p class="verse0">When Stuart return’d with secret pains,</p>
<p class="verse0">Enter’d the town at both the ends,</p>
<p class="verse0">And set upon them unawares,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Till few were left of men and horse:</p>
<p class="verse0">Their loss was this, you may consider,</p>
<p class="verse0">Because they were not got together.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Campbells sold their lives like men,</p>
<p class="verse0">And of the horsemen left were ten.</p>
<p class="verse0">This did the Highlandmen revive,</p>
<p class="verse0">And rais’d their sp’rits for more mischief,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to the Duke’s men gave a caution,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where to quarter on like occasion.</p>
<p class="verse0">His army in three divisions lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">The first at Strathbogie, they say,</p>
<p class="verse0">Second at Old Meldrum, half-way between</p>
<p class="verse0">Strathbogie town and Aberdeen,</p>
<p class="verse0">The last at Aberdeen still lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Until April on the eighth day.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">While Charles must the mountains keep,</p>
<p class="verse0">Among the goats, cows and sheep,</p>
<p class="verse0">His army sure was sorely spent,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ere into Inverness he went,</p>
<p class="verse0">Having nought but deserts by the way,</p>
<p class="verse0">Want of meat and scant of pay.</p>
<p class="verse0">Rivan of Badenoch they took,</p>
<p class="verse0">And laid it flat on every <em>nuik</em>.</p>
<p class="verse0">To Inverness when they drew near,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lord Loudon did from it retire,</p>
<p class="verse0">Having but sixteen hundred men</p>
<p class="verse0">All newly rais’d, could not preten’</p>
<p class="verse0">To face them fairly in open field:</p>
<p class="verse0">Therefore, Retreat was safest bield.</p>
<p class="verse0">Two companies he left behind,</p>
<p class="verse0">The fort to major Grant resign’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">To defend it to extremitie</p>
<p class="verse0">Strict orders, thus to do or die,</p>
<p class="verse0">But no sooner did Charles’ troops appear,</p>
<p class="verse0">Than soldiers hearts did quake for fear,</p>
<p class="verse0">And being threaten’d with a siege</p>
<p class="verse0">They durst not stand their spiteful rage.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">So town and castle became his own,</p>
<p class="verse0">The fort was levell’d with the groun’.</p>
<p class="verse0">Lord Loudon fled but little way,</p>
<p class="verse0">The firth of Murray between them lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Perth and Cromartie play’d a <em>brogue</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">Assisted by a hazie fog,</p>
<p class="verse0">Unexpectedly sallying over,</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon them fell, and would not hover,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till many they in pieces cut,</p>
<p class="verse0">Some officers they pris’ners got:</p>
<p class="verse0">As before them they could not stand,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being forc’d to flee from Sutherland.</p>
<p class="verse0">Another party at castle of Blair,</p>
<p class="verse0">Had beat the Duke’s detachment there;</p>
<p class="verse0">This gave the king’s army some pain,</p>
<p class="verse0">And rais’d their Highland blood again.</p>
<p class="verse0">Fort Augustus too they did attack,</p>
<p class="verse0">And in short time beat it to wreck:</p>
<p class="verse0">Three companies of Guise’ therein,</p>
<p class="verse0">’Gainst Highland fury not worth a pin:</p>
<p class="verse0">Major Wentworth did here command,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who had not force them to withstand,</p>
<p class="verse0">None stood but Fort William now,</p>
<p class="verse0">And it in haste they ’sieged too.</p>
<p class="verse0">A large detachment chosen was;</p>
<p class="verse0">Of artillery the best he has,</p>
<p class="verse0">Commanded by brave Stapleton,</p>
<p class="verse0">A French brig’dier of great renown.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">On the third of March at Glenavis,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which opposite Fort William is,</p>
<p class="verse0">The first attack began at sea,</p>
<p class="verse0">Betwixt the Baltimore and he,</p>
<p class="verse0">A sloop then lying at Fort William,</p>
<p class="verse0">Into the straits of Carrion,</p>
<p class="verse0">Stapleton siezing of their boat,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thought t’ master them with num’rous shot:</p>
<p class="verse0">The Serpent sloop, captain Askew</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Caus’d man his boat, with other two,</p>
<p class="verse0">And soon were master of Carrion,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where put to flight was Stapleton.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Their next ’ttempt was Kilmadie barns,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where many shot were thro’ the <em>herns</em>:</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet the Baltimore she could not stand it,</p>
<p class="verse0">Nor could their troops at all get landed:</p>
<p class="verse0">For shells and cannons play’d so fast,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their engineer they kill’d at last.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Baltimore she could not take it,</p>
<p class="verse0">Forc’d to sheer off and so forsake it,</p>
<p class="verse0">Some prisoners of Guise’s men,</p>
<p class="verse0">In this hurry did liberty gain,</p>
<p class="verse0">During the time the parties fir’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Took to their heels and so retir’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">And got safe to the garrison,</p>
<p class="verse0">Without the reach of Stapleton.</p>
<p class="verse0">Now for some time they stopped were,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thro’ loss of their chief engineer,</p>
<p class="verse0">And ere another fill’d his place,</p>
<p class="verse0">The garrison had their wall in case,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their bastions raised seven feet high,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ere the besiegers did draw nigh.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">It was on March the twenti’th day,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their battery began to play,</p>
<p class="verse0">From a hill top, call’d Sugar loaf,</p>
<p class="verse0">Eight hundred yards, or thereby off:</p>
<p class="verse0">Their shots fell weak and came too short,</p>
<p class="verse0">Some fell before they reach’d the fort:</p>
<p class="verse0">Cohorns, bombs and a twelve pounder</p>
<p class="verse0">In vain at such a distance thunder.</p>
<p class="verse0">Finding their batt’ry was too far,</p>
<p class="verse0">They erect another half way nigh’r;</p>
<p class="verse0">But being in a hollower place,</p>
<p class="verse0">It did not alter much the case,</p>
<p class="verse0">Except the cohorns and some bombs</p>
<p class="verse0">Broke some roofs, beat down two <em>lums</em>;</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Three men indeed they did dissable,</p>
<p class="verse0">And kill’d a poor horse in a stable.</p>
<p class="verse0">Stapleton a French <em>Tambour</em> sent,</p>
<p class="verse0">Beating a parly on he went:</p>
<p class="verse0">The captain ask’d for what he came?</p>
<p class="verse0">He said, From gen’ral Stapleton,</p>
<p class="verse0">To you, Sir Governor, with this letter,</p>
<p class="verse0">’Tis to surrender, You can’t do better.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then to your Gen’ral this answer give,</p>
<p class="verse0">“No letters from rebels I’ll receive,</p>
<p class="verse0">“I shall do better, and him defy,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Ev’n to the last extremity.”</p>
<p class="verse0">The drummer return’d to Stapleton,</p>
<p class="verse0">O then a fierce bombard went on,</p>
<p class="verse0">For several hours on either side,</p>
<p class="verse0">At last the garrison laid their pride,</p>
<p class="verse0">By tearing their chief battery,</p>
<p class="verse0">Flat with the ground they made it ly,</p>
<p class="verse0">And many buried were therein,</p>
<p class="verse0">Besides the wounded that did run,</p>
<p class="verse0">The people within the garrison,</p>
<p class="verse0">Without the houses keeped none,</p>
<p class="verse0">For being wounded with the slate,</p>
<p class="verse0">During the hurry of this heat:</p>
<p class="verse0">The rest behind the ramparts stood,</p>
<p class="verse0">And so were free from wounds and blood.</p>
<p class="verse0">Thus in a rage, before they tir’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Near two hundred royal were fir’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">With sixteen cannons, ’gainst the fort,</p>
<p class="verse0">As afterwards they did report:</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet did no harm was worth a fig,</p>
<p class="verse0">But a poor soldier lost his leg.</p>
<p class="verse0">And on the morrow when day appear’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">The garrison their trenches clear’d.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then for a day they let them <em>slack</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">Another batt’ry to erect,</p>
<p class="verse0">Nearer the Fort one hundred yard</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">At which no labour there was spar’d.</p>
<p class="verse0">At this time, a party sallied out</p>
<p class="verse0">To make provision in, no doubt,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who spar’d no bullock, sheep or cow,</p>
<p class="verse0">Some prisoners they in brought too</p>
<p class="verse0">From the laird of Apin’s estate,</p>
<p class="verse0">Burnt every house came in their <em>gate</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">And those who did resistance shew,</p>
<p class="verse0">They made no stop to run them thro’.</p>
<p class="verse0">Their ships came in with meal and bread</p>
<p class="verse0">So to hold out they had no dread.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Now when the last batt’ry was raised,</p>
<p class="verse0">To fire again they soon practis’d;</p>
<p class="verse0">The garrison too began a fresh,</p>
<p class="verse0">And soon their batt’ry down did thresh.</p>
<p class="verse0">At last their powder store took fire,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which dash’d the gunners here and there.</p>
<p class="verse0">The garrison perceiv’d the case,</p>
<p class="verse0">And took advantage in short space,</p>
<p class="verse0">Twelve men out of each companie,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then sallied out couragiouslie,</p>
<p class="verse0">And set upon them without dread,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till many on the place lay dead,</p>
<p class="verse0">One serjeant of the Campbells slain</p>
<p class="verse0">The rest victorious turn’d again.</p>
<p class="verse0">Into the Fort with them they drew</p>
<p class="verse0">Three brazen cannons and mortars two,</p>
<p class="verse0">Spik’d up the rest but only five,</p>
<p class="verse0">At which they could not get a <em>drive</em>:</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet timely retreat safety procur’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or with numbers they’d been o’erpowr’d.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Stapleton did yet again direct</p>
<p class="verse0">Another batt’ry there to make;</p>
<p class="verse0">But at that time came an express</p>
<p class="verse0">Forthwith to march for Inverness.</p>
<p class="verse0">Thus on the third day of April,</p>
<p class="verse0">From the third of March a dreary while.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">They left their cannon and took the rout</p>
<p class="verse0">But never more came thereabout.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Now another party prince Charles had</p>
<p class="verse0">At the castle of Blair prosper’d as bad,</p>
<p class="verse0">Under lord George Murray’s command,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who took this doughty deed in hand,</p>
<p class="verse0">For to conquer this castle of Blair:</p>
<p class="verse0">The duke of Athole oft lived there,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who was upon the Georgian side,</p>
<p class="verse0">And had the Stewarts oft aid deny’d.</p>
<p class="verse0">The garrison therein was few,</p>
<p class="verse0">Commanded by Andrew Agnew,</p>
<p class="verse0">An old Scots Worthy, I well may say,</p>
<p class="verse0">No better soldier was in’s day.</p>
<p class="verse0">He could do more by wiles and flight,</p>
<p class="verse0">Than those who were five hundred weight;</p>
<p class="verse0">He did defend them in such ways,</p>
<p class="verse0">The siege prolong’d for several days.</p>
<p class="verse0">Till word reach’d the camp at Dunkeld</p>
<p class="verse0">How with Sir Andrew it befel.</p>
<p class="verse0">Earl Crawford with the Hessian men,</p>
<p class="verse0">Two troops of horse to him did sen’;</p>
<p class="verse0">In all great haste they march’d away;</p>
<p class="verse0">But Murray got other fish to fry:</p>
<p class="verse0">For he receiv’d a hot express,</p>
<p class="verse0">Forthwith to come to Inverness,</p>
<p class="verse0">That very day that Stapleton</p>
<p class="verse0">Left the siege of Fort-William.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">All parties of the Chevalier</p>
<p class="verse0">Did to their head quarters draw near,</p>
<p class="verse0">By which Sir Andrew relief had,</p>
<p class="verse0">And made this siege a fair blockade.</p>
<p class="verse0">Here the wheel it turn’d, I trow,</p>
<p class="verse0">And luck to Charles bad adieu.</p>
<p class="verse0">’Tis oft misfortunes come together,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or after one mischief another,</p>
<p class="verse0">His men half mad for want of pay,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Had little to eat, what’s worse, I say?</p>
<p class="verse0">Being hemm’d in on ev’ry side,</p>
<p class="verse0">Among the hills and muirs so wide.</p>
<p class="verse0">On the Hazard sloop they did depen’,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which went to France for money and men:</p>
<p class="verse0">As back and fore she oft did go,</p>
<p class="verse0">Her name’s changed to Prince Charles’ Snow:</p>
<p class="verse0">On her return, unluckilie,</p>
<p class="verse0">Met with the Sheerness sloop, at sea,</p>
<p class="verse0">Commanded by Captain O’Brian,</p>
<p class="verse0">With whom she fought but did not gain</p>
<p class="verse0">The day, nor yet could get away;</p>
<p class="verse0">But was chas’d into Tongue-bay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where she upon the shallows ran,</p>
<p class="verse0">And in the fight lost many a man.</p>
<p class="verse0">O’Brian enrag’d still kept the sea,</p>
<p class="verse0">But mann’d his boat right hastilie:</p>
<p class="verse0">For fifty leagues they gave her chace,</p>
<p class="verse0">And forc’d them to land in this place;</p>
<p class="verse0">Into the country of lord Rea,</p>
<p class="verse0">From whence they no relief could ha’e.</p>
<p class="verse0">His lordship’s house it was near by,</p>

<p class="verse0">That such a thing was not to be:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Upon the eight day of April,</p>
<p class="verse0">When air and season sweet did smile,</p>
<p class="verse0">Duke William then began to move,</p>
<p class="verse0">The time and season to improve;</p>
<p class="verse0">Towards the Spey he did approach,</p>
<p class="verse0">By wary steps and easy voy’ge:</p>
<p class="verse0">His fleet on sea no faster steer’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Than he upon the land appear’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Until they reach’d the banks of Spey:</p>
<p class="verse0">On the north side great Charles lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">To keep the fords was their intent;</p>
<p class="verse0">But see’ng the cannon durst not resent,</p>
<p class="verse0">Planted to cover the only pass,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where the safe passage unto them was:</p>
<p class="verse0">So in all haste they <em>scowr’d</em> away,</p>
<p class="verse0">And let them freely pass the Spey.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Argyle’s men and lord Kingston’s horse,</p>
<p class="verse0">Did first of all the water cross,</p>
<p class="verse0">And after them the grenadiers</p>
<p class="verse0">To keep the front, if need appears:</p>
<p class="verse0">For the Duke had always in his thought,</p>
<p class="verse0">That crossing Spey would be dear bought;</p>
<p class="verse0">But when he found no opposition,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of other schemes he had suspicion:</p>
<p class="verse0">Wherein he did conjecture right,</p>
<p class="verse0">Altho’ the plot came not to light:</p>
<p class="verse0">That in the night he’d be attacked,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which by ill conduct was not acted.</p>
<p class="verse0">Thus over Spey all safely came,</p>
<p class="verse0">That rapid river and <em>stalward</em> stream;</p>
<p class="verse0">Th’ English women not us’d with wading,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being loth to lift up their plaiding</p>
<p class="verse0">Went in with petticoats and all,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which <em>fagg’d</em> their feet and made them fall.</p>
<p class="verse0">A trooper thinking lives to save,</p>
<p class="verse0">With them too got a wat’ry grave,</p>
<p class="verse0">The flood but to men’s middle went,</p>
<p class="verse0">They were with fording unacquaint:</p>
<p class="verse0">Cold water struck the women’s belly,</p>
<p class="verse0">It made them both prove faint and silly.</p>
<p class="verse0">One horseman, and four women that day,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were drown’d in crossing of the Spey:</p>
<p class="verse0">From other harms cannons did cover,</p>
<p class="verse0">And still they form’d as they came over,</p>
<p class="verse0">For to engage kept always ready,</p>
<p class="verse0">Caus’d pipes play <em>Fair play, Highland laddie</em>.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">To Elgin town they march’d that night,</p>
<p class="verse0">As the Highland core had ta’en their flight,</p>
<p class="verse0">From thence to Nairn on the next day,</p>
<p class="verse0">There on the fifteenth encamped lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where the Duke’s birth was celebrate,</p>
<p class="verse0">And Charles’ intent was to be at it;</p>
<p class="verse0">But when near to the camp they came,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">They could not execute their plan:</p>
<p class="verse0">For Murray and Sulli. could not agree,</p>
<p class="verse0">On what side the attack should be:</p>
<p class="verse0">For want of courage in such a plight,</p>
<p class="verse0">They argu’d till the morning light,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then the Duke’s drums fell a beating,</p>
<p class="verse0">And they thought fit to be retreating:</p>
<p class="verse0">So this attempt prov’d nought at all,</p>
<p class="verse0">But saving of their powder and ball.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Now Charlie and his noblemen,</p>
<p class="verse0">In council night and day were then,</p>
<p class="verse0">And in their schemes could not agree,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where <span class="smcap">Achitophels</span> among them be;</p>
<p class="verse0">Some for this, and some for that,</p>
<p class="verse0">Long time they in confusion sat:</p>
<p class="verse0">Some did incline to fight at Spey,</p>
<p class="verse0">And of all fords to stop the way;</p>
<p class="verse0">But Tullibardine and Sullivan,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were quite upon another plan,</p>
<p class="verse0">To let the Duke free passage have,</p>
<p class="verse0">And no disturbance there to give;</p>
<p class="verse0">But lead him to some ugly ground,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where cannon and horse were useless found:</p>
<p class="verse0">So pitch’d upon Culloden place,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where dykes and bogs might vex his Grace;</p>
<p class="verse0">In hopes, cannon could not get there,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which was great pain, I must declare,</p>
<p class="verse0">The way so rough was, and so ill,</p>
<p class="verse0">But drawn by men were up the hill.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Duke his march made very slow,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being form’d in lines as on they go:</p>
<p class="verse0">In four columns they march’d away,</p>
<p class="verse0">On cannon and baggage, made them stay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Did front and rear in a body keep,</p>
<p class="verse0">Except the Campbells, who ran like sheep,</p>
<p class="verse0">With Kingston’s horse as spies and van,</p>
<p class="verse0">From hill to hill they skipt and ran,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Back and fore had many a bout,</p>
<p class="verse0">Act as Jackals to search them out,</p>
<p class="verse0">And that day near the hour of twelve,</p>
<p class="verse0">At Culloden house found them all.</p>
<p class="verse0">&mdash;&mdash; The Highland army here were ranged,</p>
<p class="verse0">That no position could be changed,</p>
<p class="verse0">Twelve piece of cannon; but highly mounted;</p>
<p class="verse0">By which the gunners were affronted:</p>
<p class="verse0">For should they level ere so low,</p>
<p class="verse0">Shot, down the hill is loth to go;</p>
<p class="verse0">And though they ply’d them ne’er so warm</p>
<p class="verse0">In such a posture could not harm.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">But the Duke’s cannon so conceal’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">They thought he’d got none on that field,</p>
<p class="verse0">In the centre-line he did them screen,</p>
<p class="verse0">That they at all could not be seen.</p>
<p class="verse0">Straight on their front he did advance,</p>
<p class="verse0">On right and left his made a stance:</p>
<p class="verse0">From Charles’ batt’ry the fire began</p>
<p class="verse0">By gunners who no honour wan.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Duke perceiving that his left,</p>
<p class="verse0">Would be took weak, for such a drift</p>
<p class="verse0">Of the stout Clans were coming on them,</p>
<p class="verse0">Sent Bland and Hawley to wait ’pon them,</p>
<p class="verse0">With foot and horse and Campbells too,</p>
<p class="verse0">As good as ere <em>cauld</em> iron drew.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then seeing all in order right,</p>
<p class="verse0">The signal gave for bloody fight.</p>
<p class="verse0">His front to fall some paces back,</p>
<p class="verse0">And then the cannon began to crack.</p>
<p class="verse0">Grape them, Grape them, did he cry,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then rank and file he made them ly;</p>
<p class="verse0">When bags of balls were fir’d at once,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where they did spread, hard was the chance:</p>
<p class="verse0">It hew’d them down, aye, score by score,</p>
<p class="verse0">As grass doth fall before the mow’r.</p>
<p class="verse0">Breaches they made as large and broad,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">As avenues <em>in thro’</em> a wood;</p>
<p class="verse0">And then such terror on them fell,</p>
<p class="verse0">That what to do they could not tell;</p>
<p class="verse0">Whether that they should fight or flee,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or with the rest, stand there and die.</p>
<p class="verse0">They had no conduct to consider,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or in a body rush together;</p>
<p class="verse0">But some drew back, others advanc’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">They all into confusion launch’d.</p>
<p class="verse0">But M‘Phersons, Cam’rons and the Steuarts,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who did disdain the name of cowards,</p>
<p class="verse0">All rush’d on, quite void of fright,</p>
<p class="verse0">And chused death before a flight,</p>
<p class="verse0">Struck Barrel’s regiment on the flank,</p>
<p class="verse0">For two companies they made a blank,</p>
<p class="verse0">Wolf’s Bligh’s and Semple’s were attacked;</p>
<p class="verse0">But sore for this they were corrected.</p>
<p class="verse0">For Bland and Hawley came on behind ’em,</p>
<p class="verse0">Campbells and light horse, which so confin’d ’em</p>
<p class="verse0">Between two fires, and bay’nets fixt,</p>
<p class="verse0">That few got off being so perplext.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Campbells threw down a stone wall,</p>
<p class="verse0">To let the horsemen on them fall,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who with sword in hand put them to flight,</p>
<p class="verse0">And could no longer stand the fight.</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet many, in rage, came rushing on,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till bay’nets thro’ their backs were gone,</p>
<p class="verse0">The bright points on the other side;</p>
<p class="verse0">So bravely was their valour try’d.</p>
<p class="verse0">If all their front had so come on,</p>
<p class="verse0">I know not how the day had gone;</p>
<p class="verse0">Their lives they did not sell for nought,</p>
<p class="verse0">The Duke himself, own’d they were bought.</p>
<p class="verse0">Those on the left stood still as stupid,</p>
<p class="verse0">Some would advance, others back skipped:</p>
<p class="verse0">Dreadful cannons on them did blatter,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till at the last they’re forc’d to scatter.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">The French Brigades, who puff’d so hie,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Into a bogue were fain to flee:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Great Stapleton their Brigadier,</p>
<p class="verse0">In every <em>spaul</em> did quake for fear,</p>
<p class="verse0">Fitz James’s horse, for all their pride,</p>
<p class="verse0">Unto the rear were fain to ride.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">The Duke’s right stood and saw the fun,</p>
<p class="verse0">Some reg’ments never fir’d a gun;</p>
<p class="verse0">They only twice or thrice presented,</p>
<p class="verse0">But seeing them run it was prevented:</p>
<p class="verse0">For the order was, that fire they don’t,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till within few paces of their front.</p>
<p class="verse0">So when they see’d them so present,</p>
<p class="verse0">Back they fled with one consent,</p>
<p class="verse0">Brandisht their swords and pistols fir’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Some threw their durks and then retir’d.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Hussars likewise took the flight,</p>
<p class="verse0">And never did presume to fight;</p>
<p class="verse0">But left their leader on the field,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who as pris’ner was forc’d to yield.</p>
<p class="verse0">The noble Earl of Kilmarnock,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whose head was from his body struck,</p>
<p class="verse0">Afterwards, upon Tower-hill;</p>
<p class="verse0">Great pity ’twas this Lord to kill!</p>
<p class="verse0">Were it but for his lenity</p>
<p class="verse0">To prisoners before that day,</p>
<p class="verse0">He favour shew’d to many a hunder</p>
<p class="verse0">And in no case would hear of plunder.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Now Charles, the Prince yet kept the field,</p>
<p class="verse0">And loth was he to flee or yield:</p>
<p class="verse0">Major Kennedy with some troops of horse,</p>
<p class="verse0">Out of the field he did him force,</p>
<p class="verse0">About five miles from Inverness,</p>
<p class="verse0">The water of Nairn they did pass,</p>
<p class="verse0">As they had been for Bad’noch bound;</p>
<p class="verse0">But spread throughout the country round.</p>
<p class="verse0">And those behind on field who staid,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Ran ev’ry where, be’ng so afraid;</p>
<p class="verse0">But those who ran by Inverness,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were hotly handled in the chase.</p>
<p class="verse0">Lord Ancram and general Bland,</p>
<p class="verse0">This fierce pursuit they took in hand.</p>
<p class="verse0">With Kingston’s horse and Kerr’s dragoons,</p>
<p class="verse0">They thro’ the bonnets clave their crowns,</p>
<p class="verse0">Struck with such vigour and desperation,</p>
<p class="verse0">Some hands were swell’d on this occasion,</p>
<p class="verse0">Within the hilting of the sword,</p>
<p class="verse0">That to pull out, they seem’d full <em>gourd</em>.</p>
<p class="verse0">They would not yield as vanquish’d men,</p>
<p class="verse0">Such discipline they did not <em>ken</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">To ground their arms or turn their sword,</p>
<p class="verse0">Nor knew they ought of Quarters word;</p>
<p class="verse0">But <em>madly run</em>, was all their chance,</p>
<p class="verse0">And never turn’d to make defence.</p>
<p class="verse0">The pursuers had them at their will,</p>
<p class="verse0">Nought but follow and safely kill.</p>
<p class="verse0">Some hundreds who fell that day,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were a mean of throwing their life away.</p>
<p class="verse0">Two thousand lay upon the field,</p>
<p class="verse0">And those who took flight for their bield,</p>
<p class="verse0">Through Inverness and all about,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were hew’d down in this bloody rout:</p>
<p class="verse0">For Kingston’s men were young and rude,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of mercy nought they understood,</p>
<p class="verse0">When answer’d by a Highland tongue;</p>
<p class="verse0">But used cruelty all along.</p>
<p class="verse0">Of prisoners were told and seen,</p>
<p class="verse0">Full seven hundred and fifteen;</p>
<p class="verse0">But many more were after this,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which not into this number is;</p>
<p class="verse0">Lord Lewis Gordon, marquis of Giles.</p>
<p class="verse0">And Stapleton this number fills,</p>
<p class="verse0">Four ladies too, here taken was,</p>
<p class="verse0">And one of them into man’s dress,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Who as a Captain did appear,</p>
<p class="verse0">In fighting for her Chevalier.</p>
<p class="verse0">Five thousand stand of arms were found,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ten brazen cannons, smart and sound,</p>
<p class="verse0">Twelve stand of colours were ta’en, I know,</p>
<p class="verse0">’Twas the Royal Standard’s fate also</p>
<p class="verse0">For to be left, that fatal hour,</p>
<p class="verse0">On the field of Culloden Muir,</p>
<p class="verse0">With the baggage and milit’ry chest</p>
<p class="verse0">(Its contents did of nought consist.)</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Then brigadier Mordaunt was sent,</p>
<p class="verse0">Nine hundred chosen with him went,</p>
<p class="verse0">For to subdue all arm’d who were,</p>
<p class="verse0">Into the Frazer’s country there,</p>
<p class="verse0">Search’d ev’ry corner and each <em>quorum</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thinking that Charles was still before ’em.</p>
<p class="verse0">Strathallan fell when on his flight,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lord Balmarino the next night,</p>
<p class="verse0">Into the hands of Grant he fell,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who made him pris’ner, as they tell,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to the Duke sent him also,</p>

<p class="verse0">And with him many a hundred more,</p>
<p class="verse0">To English jails and London-tower,</p>

<p class="verse0">Lord Rae’s militia, hearing this,</p>

and narrow escape.</em></p>


<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">The Prince from Badenoch that night,</p>
<p class="verse0">Over the mountains took his flight.</p>
<p class="verse0">With only six in’s company,</p>
<p class="verse0">And one who led them on the way.</p>
<p class="verse0">O’er many a rock, thro’ glens they past,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to Invergary came at last.</p>
<p class="verse0">About two hours ere break of day;</p>
<p class="verse0">But none within that house did stay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Only one servant, the laird being gone,</p>
<p class="verse0">Bed or provisions there were none:</p>
<p class="verse0">No drink but water to be had,</p>
<p class="verse0">On the cold floor he made his bed,</p>
<p class="verse0">All in their clothes thus sleeping lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till near the middle of the day:</p>
<p class="verse0">Having had no sleep five nights before,</p>
<p class="verse0">And little food, you may be sure.</p>
<p class="verse0">No bread or cheese there could they find,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Or ought to eat of any kind.</p>
<p class="verse0">No living poultry could they get;</p>
<p class="verse0">But in the water found a net,</p>
<p class="verse0">Wherein two salmon were present,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which they took as a blessing sent,</p>
<p class="verse0">And on them heartily did dine,</p>
<p class="verse0">Having no liquor but Adam’s wine.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then to their journey set again,</p>
<p class="verse0">For Donald Cam’ron’s at Glen Bean,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where they arrived late that night,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thro’ Lochiel’s country, ’twas their fright</p>
<p class="verse0">Of being known by friends or foes:</p>
<p class="verse0">He drest himself into Burke’s clothes,</p>
<p class="verse0">The rest be’ng gone but only three,</p>
<p class="verse0">No more was in his companie.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then on the morrow, the eighteenth day,</p>
<p class="verse0">To Clan-Ronnald’s country took their way,</p>
<p class="verse0">And in Mewboll lodged that night,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being kindly us’d, but still in fright,</p>
<p class="verse0">Delay’d next day some hours, to hear</p>
<p class="verse0">How all was gone; but yet for fear</p>
<p class="verse0">They quit their horse, and took the hill,</p>
<p class="verse0">O’er mountains climb’d scarce passible,</p>
<p class="verse0">To Arisaig or Borasdale:</p>
<p class="verse0">And here themselves they did conceal</p>
<p class="verse0">At Kinloch Moidart, where they lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Not knowing what to do or say.</p>
<p class="verse0">There came lord Elcho and O’Neil,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who to their Prince did plainly tell</p>
<p class="verse0">How all had gone at Inverness,</p>
<p class="verse0">Since the fatal day of their distress;</p>
<p class="verse0">That all the Clans were scattered,</p>
<p class="verse0">So as rally again, they ne’er cou’d;</p>
<p class="verse0">For the Duke had parties ev’rywhere</p>
<p class="verse0">To burn and plunder, none did spare</p>
<p class="verse0">Who with them were the least concern’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">So where to flee must be determin’d.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Here Sullivan and many more</p>
<p class="verse0">Their council gave as bad’s before,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their Prince to flee into some isle,</p>
<p class="verse0">And there to ly <em>incog.</em> a while,</p>
<p class="verse0">Sending for one Donald MacLeod,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who knew the isles and safest road.</p>
<p class="verse0">And while they were a-planning this,</p>
<p class="verse0">An alarm came for to dismiss,</p>
<p class="verse0">A party coming was that way,</p>
<p class="verse0">Direct as knowing where they lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then to the woods all of them fled,</p>
<p class="verse0">Took sundry ways be’ng sore afraid.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Prince himself bewilder’d ran,</p>
<p class="verse0">And with him there was not a man,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being thus dejected and all alone,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thro’ the wild woods he made his moan.</p>
<p class="verse0">While thus he melancholy lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">MacLeod came past on’s road from Sky;</p>
<p class="verse0">The Prince cried boldly, What art thou?</p>
<p class="verse0">And he reply’d, What’s that to you?</p>
<p class="verse0">My name’s MacLeod, from Gaultergill,</p>
<p class="verse0">I’m not afraid it to reveal.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then said the Prince, ’Tis thee I want,</p>
<p class="verse0">I am the man who for thee sent,</p>
<p class="verse0">The Son of your King, your Prince I am,</p>
<p class="verse0">And for your pity here I came.</p>
<p class="verse0">On you, Donald, myself I throw,</p>
<p class="verse0">Do what you will, prove friend or foe.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then Donald, in tears, stood all amaz’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">With dumb surprize he on him gaz’d:</p>
<p class="verse0">My Prince, my Prince and here to lurk!</p>
<p class="verse0">Oh! this would move the heart of Turk,</p>
<p class="verse0">To see the turns of time and fate,</p>
<p class="verse0">From honour to a wretched state;</p>
<p class="verse0">I’m old, I’m old, thus did he cry;</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet t’ serve my Prince I’d live and die.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then said the Prince, Since it is so,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">With these two letters, wilt thou go,</p>
<p class="verse0">To Sir Alexander? though that he</p>
<p class="verse0">And th’ laird of MacLeod’s my enemie,</p>
<p class="verse0">I’ll yet their clemency request,</p>
<p class="verse0">If humanity lies in their breast,</p>
<p class="verse0">In noble hearts pity is found,</p>
<p class="verse0">They’ll land me safe on German ground.</p>
<p class="verse0">No, no, said Donald, that will not do;</p>
<p class="verse0">For now they’re both in search of you:</p>
<p class="verse0">But my service sha’n’t cost you a groat,</p>
<p class="verse0">Near this there lies an eight oar’d boat,</p>
<p class="verse0">Get all you have, ready on sight,</p>
<p class="verse0">And we will go on board this night.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">To this the Prince did well comply,</p>
<p class="verse0">They went in search of all was nigh,</p>
<p class="verse0">To wit, brave O’Neil and Sullivan</p>
<p class="verse0">With Allan M‘Donald of Elen-o-ron,</p>
<p class="verse0">Alex. M‘Donald, Edward Burke,</p>
<p class="verse0">And four stout men the boat to work,</p>
<p class="verse0">Donald MacLeod was pilot too,</p>
<p class="verse0">No more were in his retinue.</p>
<p class="verse0">For store they had four pecks of meal,</p>
<p class="verse0">A pot they bought for making kail:</p>
<p class="verse0">This was on April twenty-sixth,</p>
<p class="verse0">They put to sea, full sore perplext,</p>
<p class="verse0">At the same place he came on shore,</p>
<p class="verse0">When first he landed the year before.</p>
<p class="verse0">Dark was the night, the wind blew high,</p>
<p class="verse0">The rain drove on, black was the sky,</p>
<p class="verse0">No deck or cover was to be got,</p>
<p class="verse0">Pump or compass had they not;</p>
<p class="verse0">Before the wind they durst not stand;</p>
<p class="verse0">Because they knew not where to land:</p>
<p class="verse0">In all the Isles were armed men;</p>
<p class="verse0">But in what place they did not ken.</p>
<p class="verse0">Ev’ry wave threat’ning their last,</p>
<p class="verse0">And shipt great seas, which o’er them past;</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet kept above from sand and rock,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Till to morrow ’bout seven o’clock,</p>
<p class="verse0">They made Rushness-point, on the long isle,</p>
<p class="verse0">Call’d <em>Benbecula</em> in Gallic style,</p>
<p class="verse0">Two hundred miles in eight hours space,</p>
<p class="verse0">Past many a rock and dang’rous place,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where militia boats were out on spy,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which otherwise he’d not got by:</p>
<p class="verse0">But this vi’lent storm they could not stand,</p>
<p class="verse0">All fled for shelter to the land.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Now on this isle they landed were;</p>
<p class="verse0">But found no house or shelter there,</p>
<p class="verse0">Except an old stye of a byre,</p>
<p class="verse0">Wherein they kindled up a fire,</p>
<p class="verse0">Shot a cow and did her boil,</p>
<p class="verse0">And made fine brochan of her oil.</p>
<p class="verse0">The place was hollow and remote,</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon dry land hauld up their boat;</p>
<p class="verse0">But when they view’d the raging sea,</p>
<p class="verse0">They prais’d their Maker heartilie,</p>
<p class="verse0">To think what dangers they’d come by</p>
<p class="verse0">’Twixt the isles of Cole, Mull and Skye.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">The storm it still increased high’r,</p>
<p class="verse0">For fourteen hours it blew like fire.</p>
<p class="verse0">They spy’d, for dangers, round about,</p>
<p class="verse0">And then to sleep their prince was put.</p>
<p class="verse0">No bed-clothes but the sail all wet,</p>
<p class="verse0">Without straw, bolster, or a matt,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where cows had lain all night before,</p>
<p class="verse0">A poor palace without a door,</p>
<p class="verse0">A bed of state, all wet with <em>shern</em>:</p>
<p class="verse0">This may the great humil’ty learn.</p>
<p class="verse0">Here they remain’d for nights two,</p>
<p class="verse0">Until the storm did overblow:</p>
<p class="verse0">And then for Stornaway set sail,</p>
<p class="verse0">But meeting with a desp’rate gale,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were drove on <em>Scalpa</em>-isle, or <em>Glass</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which to one MacLeod belonging was,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">By whom they wou’d been <em>gripped</em> fast;</p>
<p class="verse0">But for a shipwreckt crew they past,</p>
<p class="verse0">Old Sullivan the Prince’s father,</p>
<p class="verse0">And ev’ry one gave names to other.</p>
<p class="verse0">They said, they were to Orkneys bound,</p>
<p class="verse0">And here great lenity they found</p>
<p class="verse0">From Donald Campbell, a farmer there,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who for a passage did prepare</p>
<p class="verse0">A boat of his own for Stornaway.</p>
<p class="verse0">Which went off on the first of May,</p>
<p class="verse0">With Donald MacLeod, his trusty guide,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who went a vessel to provide,</p>
<p class="verse0">To get to the Orkneys by all means:</p>
<p class="verse0">For there he thought to meet with frien’s,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who, well he knew, would use their pow’r,</p>
<p class="verse0">To land him on the German shore.</p>
<p class="verse0">And in three days a message came,</p>
<p class="verse0">That a ship was ready at his deman’.</p>
<p class="verse0">Another boat was mann’d with speed,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to Storn’way they did proceed,</p>
<p class="verse0">Landing upon MacKinnon’s ground</p>
<p class="verse0">At Loch Seaforth, then to walk round,</p>
<p class="verse0">Long thirty miles, upon their foot,</p>
<p class="verse0">Before to Ayrnisk point they got.</p>
<p class="verse0">None with him but only Sullivan,</p>
<p class="verse0">Brave O’Neil and another man,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who was to guide them on the way;</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet by good chance led them astray:</p>
<p class="verse0">Long eighteen hours this stage it was,</p>
<p class="verse0">Through a long Muir all wet to <em>plash</em>:</p>
<p class="verse0">But had they come the nearest way,</p>
<p class="verse0">They had been catch’d in Stornaway.</p>
<p class="verse0">About a half mile from the town,</p>
<p class="verse0">Faint and weary they all sat down,</p>
<p class="verse0">And sent their guide for Donald MacLeod,</p>
<p class="verse0">To bring refreshment if he cou’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who brought them brandy, cheese and bread,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Which cheer’d their hearts in time of need.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then took him to Lady Kildoun’s,</p>
<p class="verse0">The only friend found in that bounds,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who kindly did them all intreat</p>
<p class="verse0">And well refresh’d he went to sleep.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">So Donald return’d into the town,</p>
<p class="verse0">And found all to confusion grown,</p>
<p class="verse0">Above two hundred in arms were,</p>
<p class="verse0">And <em>furich ha nish</em> every where.</p>
<p class="verse0">A clergyman from the South Uist</p>
<p class="verse0">He sent a letter, for truth almost,</p>
<p class="verse0">That the Prince, with above five hunder,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was coming for to burn and plunder.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then Donald to their Chiefs did go,</p>
<p class="verse0">And curs’d and swore it was not so:</p>
<p class="verse0">For the Prince has not got a man but three,</p>
<p class="verse0">And I one of his number be.</p>
<p class="verse0">So gentlemen, think what you do,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lest, when too late, you come to rue;</p>
<p class="verse0">For if Seaforth himself were here,</p>
<p class="verse0">A hair of’s head you durst not <em>steer</em>;</p>
<p class="verse0">For, if you kill him, or catch alive,</p>
<p class="verse0">Think not for such an act to thrive.</p>
<p class="verse0">This island lies far out at sea,</p>
<p class="verse0">In faith it will revenged be</p>
<p class="verse0">By favourites he hath abroad,</p>
<p class="verse0">So stop your fury, cries brave MacLeod,</p>
<p class="verse0">For surely, gentlemen, if you do it,</p>
<p class="verse0">Your babes unborn may come to rue it.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Then said they, Well, since it is so,</p>
<p class="verse0">Out of this island let him go;</p>
<p class="verse0">For if the rabble come to hear it,</p>
<p class="verse0">They’ll do it through a zealous sp’rit.</p>
<p class="verse0">The wind is fair and so be gone,</p>
<p class="verse0">We’ll still the people and send them home.</p>
<p class="verse0">Keep all right snug and let none know</p>
<p class="verse0">Whether he’s in this isle or no.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">The boatmen hearing of such a rout,</p>
<p class="verse0">And fearing what might be their lot,</p>
<p class="verse0">Two with the boat fled to the sea,</p>
<p class="verse0">And two up to the muirs did hie.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">MacLeod and Burke, here left on shore,</p>
<p class="verse0">Went to their Prince with hearts full sore.</p>
<p class="verse0">Cry’d Sullivan, We’ll take the hill,</p>
<p class="verse0">No, said the Prince, We’ll stand it still:</p>
<p class="verse0">Since here is friendship in the least,</p>
<p class="verse0">Take ye no fear, we’ll be releas’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">So in that night return’d again</p>
<p class="verse0">Their boat from sea, with the two men;</p>
<p class="verse0">But the other two who took the hill,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where they ran I cannot tell.</p>
<p class="verse0">Next morn they put to sea again,</p>
<p class="verse0">Though hard beset for want of men,</p>
<p class="verse0">Having only three who understood</p>
<p class="verse0">Either to row, or sail to crowd.</p>
<p class="verse0">For store they got two pecks of meal,</p>
<p class="verse0">Brandy, beef, butter and ale,</p>
<p class="verse0">So bid adieu to brave Kildoun,</p>
<p class="verse0">As to the Orkneys they were boun’.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">But to the south as they did steer,</p>
<p class="verse0">Two English ships there did appear,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which made them all in haste to turn,</p>
<p class="verse0">And put into the isle of Euirn,</p>
<p class="verse0">A desart place, where none abode,</p>
<p class="verse0">One mile in length, another broad,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where fishers oft frequent by day;</p>
<p class="verse0">But seeing them all fled away,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thinking they were the King’s press-boat,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their fish behind was all forgot,</p>
<p class="verse0">Both fresh and drying on the rock,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of Cod and Ling, the poor men’s stock;</p>
<p class="verse0">And here they stay’d a day or two,</p>
<p class="verse0">Until the ships were out of view,</p>
<p class="verse0">And on the fish well did they fare,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Although their lodging was but bare,</p>
<p class="verse0">An old hut, like a swine’s stye</p>
<p class="verse0">Which fishers us’d to occupy:</p>
<p class="verse0">They had no bed but heathry feal,</p>
<p class="verse0">The hut’s roof cover’d with the sail.</p>
<p class="verse0">They roasted fish and brandy drank,</p>
<p class="verse0">No host they had to pay or thank.</p>
<p class="verse0">For what they did the fishers bereave,</p>
<p class="verse0">He was amind money to leave:</p>
<p class="verse0">But Donald says, No not a <em>snishing</em>;</p>
<p class="verse0">For that would cause a strong suspicion,</p>
<p class="verse0">That some good fellows had been here;</p>
<p class="verse0">Therefore be not so mad, my dear,</p>
<p class="verse0">For ’tis the men of wars’ men’s way,</p>
<p class="verse0">To take all fish, but not to pay.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Now here to stay they thought was vain,</p>
<p class="verse0">On the tenth of May set sail again,</p>
<p class="verse0">And back to Scalpa came once more,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where they were kindly us’d before,</p>
<p class="verse0">And offer’d money for men and boat;</p>
<p class="verse0">But such a thing could not be got,</p>
<p class="verse0">To venture with them out to sea,</p>
<p class="verse0">To Noraway or Germanie.&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">But here they found danger to stay,</p>
<p class="verse0">So in all haste they put away;</p>
<p class="verse0">For men in arms in ev’ry place,</p>
<p class="verse0">In search of him were in full chace.</p>
<p class="verse0">Ships and boats watching by sea,</p>
<p class="verse0">So without fresh store they’re forc’d to flee:</p>
<p class="verse0">And coming past the South of Uist,</p>
<p class="verse0">An English ship before they wist,</p>
<p class="verse0">Commanded by one Ferguson,</p>
<p class="verse0">For three full leagues came chasing on:</p>
<p class="verse0">They kept by shore, to windward lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till in the Loch call’d Esca-bay.</p>
<p class="verse0">Got on an island, and then by chance,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Wind contrary rose and drove them thence.</p>
<p class="verse0">Rain and fog did favour shew,</p>
<p class="verse0">So who they chac’d they did not know.</p>
<p class="verse0">Well, said Charles, I see my lot</p>
<p class="verse0">Is neither to be drown’d nor shot,</p>
<p class="verse0">Nor can they e’er take me alive,</p>
<p class="verse0">While wind and rain against them strive.</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet piercing hunger’s hard command:</p>
<p class="verse0">For here no fresh water they <em>fand</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to big isles they durst not go;</p>
<p class="verse0">But such as were a mile or two.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">So here they were so hard bestead,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of salt water they <em>dramack</em> made,</p>
<p class="verse0">And of it hastily did eat,</p>
<p class="verse0">Hunger for sauce, made it good meat.</p>
<p class="verse0">If e’er I mount a throne, said he,</p>
<p class="verse0">I’ll mind who din’d this day with me.</p>
<p class="verse0">A bottle of brandy then he took,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to them all drank <em>better luck</em>.</p>
<p class="verse0">So then for <em>Benbecula</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">They hoisted sail, and steer’d awa’:</p>
<p class="verse0">And landed there among the rocks,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where Crab-fish and Partan flocks,</p>
<p class="verse0">To fishing these, with speed went all,</p>
<p class="verse0">And soon did fill a wooden pail.</p>
<p class="verse0">The hut was two miles from the shore,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where Charles carried this store,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lest suspicion should arise,</p>
<p class="verse0">This he did for mere disguise:</p>
<p class="verse0">And when near to this hut they drew,</p>
<p class="verse0">Such a cottage one did ne’er view,</p>
<p class="verse0">On feet and hands they <em>crawled</em> in,</p>
<p class="verse0">Sowre was the smoke their eyes to blin’:</p>
<p class="verse0">Then Edward Burke digg’d down the door</p>
<p class="verse0">And made the entry somewhat more.</p>
<p class="verse0">’Twas here Clan-Ron. did visit make,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">To see what measures they could take,</p>
<p class="verse0">For sending him to France again,</p>
<p class="verse0">To see him so, it gave him pain,</p>
<p class="verse0">No shirts he had excepting two,</p>
<p class="verse0">And these unwash’d like <em>dish-clouts</em> blue;</p>
<p class="verse0">Sculking, lurking, here and there,</p>
<p class="verse0">A prey to all like hounds on hare,</p>
<p class="verse0">Though in times of prosperity,</p>
<p class="verse0">He was extoll’d most gallantly.</p>
<p class="verse0">Thus he no longer here could trust;</p>
<p class="verse0">But to Cardail into South Uist,</p>
<p class="verse0">He caus’d him to remove and go,</p>
<p class="verse0">And did provide for him also</p>
<p class="verse0">Bread, brandy, wine and clothes,</p>
<p class="verse0">And such necess’ries as he chose.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">At this time the faithful MacLeod,</p>
<p class="verse0">In Campbell’s boat the sail did croud,</p>
<p class="verse0">And steer’d for the main land again;</p>
<p class="verse0">How matters stood he long’d to <em>ken</em></p>
<p class="verse0">With brave Lochiel and Murray too,</p>
<p class="verse0">And have their council what to do.</p>
<p class="verse0">Murray’s answer was, My money’s gone,</p>
<p class="verse0">And help from me you can get none.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then Donald laid out what cash he had</p>
<p class="verse0">For liquor and for other trade,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whereof his master stood in need,</p>
<p class="verse0">And so return’d again with speed,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being only eighteen days away,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which to his Prince seem’d a long stay.</p>
<p class="verse0">No counsel he brought, as I heard tell;</p>
<p class="verse0">But ev’ry man do for himsel,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which made his Master quite amaz’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">And for a time he on him gaz’d:</p>
<p class="verse0">It pierced Donald’s heart to see</p>
<p class="verse0">A Prince into such misery,</p>
<p class="verse0">Confin’d into a stinking stye,</p>
<p class="verse0">And ’bove his head two hydes of <em>kye</em>,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">To skonce away the sooty rain.</p>
<p class="verse0">And all his clothes in dirty stain.</p>
<p class="verse0">At this time soldi’rs came to Raski,</p>
<p class="verse0">An island, in length but miles three,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lying ’twixt Barra and South Uist;</p>
<p class="verse0">And therefore flee again he must.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">The Prince, O’Neil and Sullivan,</p>
<p class="verse0">Edward Burke and Donald the man,</p>
<p class="verse0">Just from the foot of Corradail,</p>
<p class="verse0">In Campbell’s boat they did set sail,</p>
<p class="verse0">And landed in the isle of Ouia,</p>
<p class="verse0">From South Uist not far awa’,</p>
<p class="verse0">And there they stayed a few nights;</p>
<p class="verse0">But constantly were in sad <em>plights</em>:</p>
<p class="verse0">For armed boats still passing by,</p>
<p class="verse0">They knew not where to hide or ly.</p>
<p class="verse0">Charles, O’Neil and a sure guide,</p>
<p class="verse0">Went thence unto Rushness to hide;</p>
<p class="verse0">But was not there above nights two,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till information was all thro’,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where he lodged at Rushness,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which trusty Donald did distress:</p>
<p class="verse0">So he, that night, with Sullivan</p>
<p class="verse0">Set sail, to save him if they can,</p>
<p class="verse0">And got him once more safe on board;</p>
<p class="verse0">But wind and rain upon him pour’d:</p>
<p class="verse0">So at Ushness point they shelter took,</p>
<p class="verse0">And lodg’d under a clifted rock.</p>
<p class="verse0">This storm it did the whole day blow,</p>
<p class="verse0">And then at night they came to know</p>
<p class="verse0">Of a party, distant, but miles two:</p>
<p class="verse0">So to sea again they’re forced to go.</p>
<p class="verse0">And as they steer’d to Loch Boisdale,</p>
<p class="verse0">One of the sailors a swearing fell,</p>
<p class="verse0">He saw a boat full of Marines,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which prov’d a rock at some distance.</p>
<p class="verse0">Cry’d, Hardy weather, and ship about,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Then to Celie-stella that night they put.</p>
<p class="verse0">On next day Donald spy’d afar,</p>
<p class="verse0">Two sail of English men of war;</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet here they stayed for some days,</p>
<p class="verse0">And could not rest in any ways.</p>
<p class="verse0">Hearing captain Scot on shore was come</p>
<p class="verse0">At Kilbride, two miles off from them.</p>
<p class="verse0">Thus now they all were forc’d to part,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their Prince went off with heavy heart,</p>
<p class="verse0">And with him took none but O’Neil,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whose heart he found as true as steel.</p>
<p class="verse0">Two shirts apiece, for baggage they took,</p>
<p class="verse0">Tied up into a wallet or pock,</p>
<p class="verse0">Around the Prince’s neck and shoulder,</p>
<p class="verse0">Like master and man they trudge together.</p>
<p class="verse0">So here we leave them for a while</p>
<p class="verse0">In lonesome caves and mountains wild.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">The others two days hover’d near,</p>

<p class="verse0">The red coats swarming all around,</p>
<p class="verse0">And yet by chance none of them found.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then Donald MacLeod he went away,</p>
<p class="verse0">And was ta’en at Slate in isle of Sky,</p>
<p class="verse0">By Allan M‘Donald, the laird of Knock,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who him on board the Furnace took,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where gen’ral Campbell and Ferguson</p>
<p class="verse0">For to examine him thus began&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse2"><em>Gen.</em> Was you with the Pretender, or was you no?</p>
<p class="verse0"><em>Heth</em> was I, <em>quoth</em> Donald, and that you know.</p>
<p class="verse2"><em>Gen.</em> Do you know what’s bidden for his head?</p>
<p class="verse0">Thirty thousand pound, a bra’ sum indeed!</p>
<p class="verse0"><em>Prutish</em>, quo’ Donald, it’s no worth a straw,</p>
<p class="verse0">Her ain sound conscience is better nor’t a’:</p>
<p class="verse0">Tho’ I’d got Scotland and England, a’ for my pains,</p>
<p class="verse0">I wadna see him hurt, for your muckle gains.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">He’s a good civil shentleman, his life on me threw,</p>
<p class="verse0">Wad I kill him, or drown him, or gie him to you.</p>
<p class="verse0">And deil care what ye do, he’s now far awa’,</p>
<p class="verse0">The win ran awa’ wi’m, the like you ne’er saw:</p>
<p class="verse0">For the win and water, Sir, did sae combine,</p>
<p class="verse0">Carri’d him twa hunder mile in aught hours time,</p>
<p class="verse0">They thought Donald a fool of the honest kind,</p>
<p class="verse0">He confessed so freely all to their mind,</p>
<p class="verse0">Suppos’d the Prince might lurking stay</p>
<p class="verse0">Into the isle of St. Kilday,</p>
<p class="verse0">A little island which does stand,</p>
<p class="verse0">Far nor-west from isles or land,</p>
<p class="verse0">The property of the laird MacLeod,</p>
<p class="verse0">A barren soil, and poor abode,</p>
<p class="verse0">Famed most for Soland Geese;</p>
<p class="verse0">Sea fowl and fish their living is:</p>
<p class="verse0">And there they thought, as Donald spake</p>
<p class="verse0">The Young Pretender for to take.</p>
<p class="verse0">Poor Donald to London they sent away,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where he twelve months in prison lay;</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet got his liberty at last,</p>
<p class="verse0">When the act-indemnity was past.</p>
<p class="verse0">Gen’ral Campbell with an armed fleet,</p>
<p class="verse0">Around St. Kilda came complete,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which frightened the poor natives there,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who ran to holes like fox or hare:</p>
<p class="verse0">And when they reach’d the wretched shore,</p>
<p class="verse0">They catched some who to them swore,</p>
<p class="verse0">That none did in that place sojourn,</p>
<p class="verse0">But who were in St. Kilda born:</p>
<p class="verse0">Of a Pretender they nothing knew;</p>
<p class="verse0">But what they heard of a boat’s crew,</p>
<p class="verse0">How the laird MacLeod had arm’d his men,</p>
<p class="verse0">To fight against some ill woman,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who lived somewhere far away;</p>
<p class="verse0">And this was all they had to say.</p>
<p class="verse0">So the gen’ral soon return’d again</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">And saw St. Kilda for his pain.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">And here we’ll leave the Prince a while,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who hunted was from isle to isle,</p>
<p class="verse0">O’er hills and mountains, wood and glen,</p>
<p class="verse0">As afterwards I’ll let you ken.</p>
<p class="verse0">Poor Edward Burke was left alone,</p>
<p class="verse0">For now companions had he none,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lodg’d in a cave for weeks three,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ate Dulce and Lampets from the sea:</p>
<p class="verse0">In short, he thought he would turn wild,</p>
<p class="verse0">Seeing no man, woman, or child;</p>
<p class="verse0">Till an honest Souter and his wife,</p>
<p class="verse0">Agreed for to sustain his life,</p>
<p class="verse0">For two long months, he said, and more,</p>
<p class="verse0">Some meat each night they to him bore,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their like was not in all North Uist,</p>
<p class="verse0">For to pity rebels no man durst:</p>
<p class="verse0">Because ev’n at that very time,</p>
<p class="verse0">It had been made a mighty crime,</p>
<p class="verse0">Read from the pulpits by the priests,</p>
<p class="verse0">That none should pity man or beasts,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who had along with Charlie been,</p>
<p class="verse0">Give them no victuals, nor close their een</p>
<p class="verse0">In sleep, or warm within a door,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or excommunicate to be therefore,</p>
<p class="verse0">Besides, the pains of milit’ry law,</p>
<p class="verse0">Hanged or shot one of the twa.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Of this act I know not what to say,</p>
<p class="verse0">Since Solomon speaks another way,</p>
<p class="verse0">And a great, yea wiser King than he,</p>
<p class="verse0">Bids us to feed our enemie,</p>
<p class="verse0">And give him water for to drink:</p>
<p class="verse0">For me, I know not what to think.</p>
<p class="verse0">But Burke of all at last got free,</p>
<p class="verse0">When th’ act of grace gave libertie,</p>
<p class="verse0">And home to Edinburgh came again,</p>
<p class="verse0">For’s love to Charles got nought but pain,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Now, the royal Duke, at Inverness,</p>
<p class="verse0">Did the whole North fully possess,</p>
<p class="verse0">Encamp’d, and sent his parties out</p>
<p class="verse0">To burn and plunder round about</p>
<p class="verse0">All the offenders, who for their crime,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were severely punish’d at this time.</p>
<p class="verse0">All those who were loyal and true,</p>
<p class="verse0">Had some acknowledgement as their due.</p>
<p class="verse0">He number’d first what he had lost,</p>
<p class="verse0">And what his signal vict’ry cost.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Lord Robert Ker was ’mong the slain,</p>
<p class="verse0">A brave captain of Barrel’s men;</p>
<p class="verse0">Of Price’s reg’ment, captain Grossot</p>
<p class="verse0">Here did fall, it was his lot,</p>
<p class="verse0">Captain Campbell of Argyleshire men,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was likewise found among the slain.</p>
<p class="verse0">Near six hundred, rank and file, lay there,</p>
<p class="verse0">Two hundred and forty wounded were.</p>
<p class="verse0">His sole reflection was, in the chase,</p>
<p class="verse0">The Pretender’s rout he could not trace,</p>
<p class="verse0">Any farther than that afternoon,</p>
<p class="verse0">He drank with Lovat when all was done,</p>
<p class="verse0">When his very tears mingl’d with wine;</p>
<p class="verse0">But never could be catch’d <em>sinsyne</em>.</p>
<p class="verse0">As some ran east, and some ran west,</p>
<p class="verse0">To south and north in crouds they past;</p>
<p class="verse0">Some to Argyleshire, through Kintyre,</p>
<p class="verse0">And into Ireland flew like fire.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Tullibairn by Loch Lomond came,</p>
<p class="verse0">Fled from the battle into the flame,</p>
<p class="verse0">Into the house of Drummiekill,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who stood on the cross way, to kill</p>
<p class="verse0">Those who from the battle fly,</p>
<p class="verse0">Against all such does Moses cry,</p>
<p class="verse0">As in the sacred Write, we read,</p>
<p class="verse0">They’re curs’d who’re guilty of such deed:</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet here was Tullibardine gripped,</p>
<p class="verse0">When from the roaring guns escaped,</p>
<p class="verse0">And prisoner to London led;</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet dy’d there quietly in his bed.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Duke William still camp’d in the north,</p>
<p class="verse0">All was in stir beyond the Forth,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ports, pass, and ferries guarded,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who catch’d a rebel was well rewarded.</p>
<p class="verse0">Few but preachers, at this day,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were counted righteous in this way:</p>
<p class="verse0">For where the minister said the word,</p>
<p class="verse0">To life and liberty they’re restor’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Resign their arms, with Mess John’s line</p>
<p class="verse0">That they were prest for to combine</p>
<p class="verse0">To go with Charlie, and his crew,</p>
<p class="verse0">By force control’d&mdash;&mdash; ’Tis very true,</p>
<p class="verse0">Most of the common men were prest,</p>
<p class="verse0">Drove to the slaughter like a beast:</p>
<p class="verse0">But one thing of Highlanders I see,</p>
<p class="verse0">To them they serve they’ll faithful be;</p>
<p class="verse0">For those who serv’d King George, just here,</p>
<p class="verse0">’Gainst the rebels proved most severe,</p>
<p class="verse0">And rebels, who afterwards did list,</p>
<p class="verse0">Loyaller hearts no man could trust:</p>
<p class="verse0">And, ev’n the conquering of this field,</p>
<p class="verse0">Unto the English I will not yield:</p>
<p class="verse0">Had Scots and Irish run away,</p>
<p class="verse0">They’d found it hard to gain the day;</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet after all they ’gan to boast,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">’Twas they only who rul’d the roast,</p>
<p class="verse0">And even where in camp they lay</p>
<p class="verse0">To upbraid the Scots, and oft did say,</p>
<p class="verse0">Mocking the mis’ries that befel,</p>
<p class="verse0">“These Scotsmen are but rebels all,</p>
<p class="verse0">“For which they all should hanged be,”&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">Which rous’d the Scots most veh’mentlie:</p>
<p class="verse0">And when they did complain thereof,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were answer’d with a mere <em>put off</em>:</p>
<p class="verse0">This did enrage them still the more,</p>
<p class="verse0">Vengeance to seek by the <em>Clay-more</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which all into confusion threw:</p>
<p class="verse0">The Scots into a body drew,</p>
<p class="verse0">Irish, by blood and love allied,</p>
<p class="verse0">Did join unto the Scottish side.</p>
<p class="verse0">His Grace, the Duke, perceiving this,</p>
<p class="verse0">Into this broil most active was,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who, as with no party he would stand;</p>
<p class="verse0">But charg’d them by his high command,</p>
<p class="verse0">For to be still, and silent be,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till he’d the dispute rectifie;</p>
<p class="verse0">Then agents from each side were chose,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whom he in council did enclose,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where they made a solemn act,</p>
<p class="verse0">“That by a thousand on the back,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Every man should punish’d be,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Who’d thus upbraid any countrie.”</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">So this again cemented peace,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thro’ mediation of his Grace,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which was indeed a virtuous scheme,</p>
<p class="verse0">And adds great honour to his name:</p>
<p class="verse0">For had they once come on to blows,</p>
<p class="verse0">’T had been the glory of their foes,</p>
<p class="verse0">And the murd’ring of one another;</p>
<p class="verse0">But now they’re Britons all together,</p>
<p class="verse0">And yet the spite ended not here,</p>
<p class="verse0">As afterwards you’ll come to hear;</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">But agitated the Parliament,</p>
<p class="verse0">Though contrary, it with them went,</p>
<p class="verse0">To put the Scots beating away,</p>
<p class="verse0">A march which vex’d them ev’ry day:</p>
<p class="verse0">Because it was a grief to hear it,</p>
<p class="verse0">And very irksome to their spirit,</p>
<p class="verse0">The dinging down of <em>Tamtallan</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">They swore it mean’d some other <em>dwallion</em>.</p>
<p class="verse0">The bonnets, plaids, and spotted coats,</p>
<p class="verse0">A dress long time worn by the Scots,</p>
<p class="verse0">These by an act were laid aside,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thro’ nought, I think, but spite and pride:</p>
<p class="verse0">For when the Scots they came to need,</p>
<p class="verse0">They were restor’d again with speed,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ev’n by an order of the crown;</p>
<p class="verse0">But <em>Tamtallan</em> was ne’er beat down,</p>
<p class="verse0">The Scots still kept by their old march,</p>
<p class="verse0">In spite of all their foes could urge.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">But the cause of the Duke’s long stay here,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was to find out the Chevalier,</p>
<p class="verse0">As Scotland round by sea was guarded,</p>
<p class="verse0">If catch’d on land, so high rewarded</p>
<p class="verse0">The apprehender was to be,</p>
<p class="verse0">There was no hopes he could get free.</p>
<p class="verse0">Hesse camps, did at Perth and Stirling stand,</p>
<p class="verse0">Armed militia through all the land,</p>
<p class="verse0">And parties searching ev’ry isle:</p>
<p class="verse0">Being heard of ev’ry other while,</p>
<p class="verse0">They still kept on a close pursuing,</p>
<p class="verse0">Hard was the hunt for Charlie’s ruin.</p>
<p class="verse0">All prisoners, they catch’d, of note,</p>
<p class="verse0">On ship-board were securely put,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to England sent, trial to stand,</p>
<p class="verse0">But deserters judg’d were in Scotland,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who had as soldiers with Charlie gone,</p>
<p class="verse0">They hang’d and shot them every one:</p>
<p class="verse0">For Hawley’s verdict was so quick,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">“Go hang the dogs up by the neck,”</p>
<p class="verse0">Which was no sooner said than done,</p>
<p class="verse0">No pity he shew’d on woman’s son.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Duke, by half, not so severe,</p>
<p class="verse0">Did often the condemn’d set clear,</p>
<p class="verse0">Made his soldiers say, he was too civil;</p>
<p class="verse0">But swore, That Hawley wou’d hang the devil.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Duke did love to burn and plunder,</p>
<p class="verse0">And sweet revenge upon them thunder,</p>
<p class="verse0">On house and huts made devastation,</p>
<p class="verse0">As it had been a foreign nation.</p>
<p class="verse0">Their whole utensils, rock and reel,</p>
<p class="verse0">To see in flames he loved well,</p>
<p class="verse0">With dogs and cats, the rats and mice,</p>
<p class="verse0">And their old shirts, with nites and lice,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were all unto the flames consign’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">To bring them to a better mind,</p>
<p class="verse0">And never more for to rebel,</p>
<p class="verse0">A doleful time for <em>her nain sell</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">For all that <em>she</em> had done or said,</p>
<p class="verse0"><em>She</em> thought it more than double paid;</p>
<p class="verse0">Eating kirns, and supping sheese,</p>
<p class="verse0">And codding of the Lothian pease,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or taking a bit of beef to eat,</p>
<p class="verse0">When <em>she</em> could get no other meat;</p>
<p class="verse0">And when <em>she</em> met a Lalan-rogue,</p>
<p class="verse0"><em>But pate a shainshment on her brogue,</em></p>
<p class="verse0"><em>The soger has done a ten times mair,</em></p>
<p class="verse0"><em>Brunt her house, taen a her geer,</em></p>
<p class="verse0"><em>And after that cuts aff her head,</em></p>
<p class="verse0"><em>An shot on them that frae her fled</em>.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">For all who did from the soldiers fly,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were fir’d upon immediately,</p>
<p class="verse0">By which, many a poor innocent</p>
<p class="verse0">Was put to death, by them unkent,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their flying away caus’d the error,</p>
<p class="verse0">The red-coats were to them a terror.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Now Charles concealed was in Uist,</p>
<p class="verse0">And there to stay no longer durst,</p>
<p class="verse0">The Campbells were coming <em>a ho</em>, <em>a ho</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">He durst not bide, and could not go:</p>
<p class="verse0">Every day he saw them well,</p>
<p class="verse0">And had none with him but O’Neil.</p>
<p class="verse0">The day was long and hot the sun,</p>
<p class="verse0">About the twenty first of June,</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon a mountain top they lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">And saw their motions ev’ry way,</p>
<p class="verse0">From glen to glen, caves and rocks,</p>
<p class="verse0">As ever hounds did search for fox,</p>
<p class="verse0">Campbells, and lads with the red coat,</p>
<p class="verse0">With them guides knew every spot,</p>
<p class="verse0">And corner of that country side;</p>
<p class="verse0">So here it dang’rous was to bide.</p>
<p class="verse0">But in a desart place remote,</p>
<p class="verse0">They found a lonely dismal hut,</p>
<p class="verse0">And there to stay they judged best,</p>
<p class="verse0">Until part of the hurry past.</p>
<p class="verse0">Such venison as they could take,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of ev’ry thing a prey they make:</p>
<p class="verse0">It was not out of cov’tous greed;</p>
<p class="verse0">But only as they stood in need.</p>
<p class="verse0">O’Neil alone was out at last,</p>
<p class="verse0">To hear of what was done or past,</p>
<p class="verse0">And met a lady whom he knew,</p>
<p class="verse0">Miss MacDonald good and true,</p>
<p class="verse0">To her their straits he did reveal,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who did with tears their sorrows feel,</p>
<p class="verse0">And vow’d by all was dear within her,</p>
<p class="verse0">She’d them relieve, if they should skin her:</p>
<p class="verse0">Then hasten’d O’Neil to him away,</p>
<p class="verse0">Appointing where to meet next day,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to the Prince with him did go,</p>
<p class="verse0">Her servant did the secret know,</p>
<p class="verse0">One Neil MacKechnie, an honest heart,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Who in ev’ry point did act his part,</p>
<p class="verse0">There, they their whole plan did frame:</p>
<p class="verse0">And then to Malton came again</p>
<p class="verse0">Miss Flora and her man next day,</p>
<p class="verse0">Going to Clan Ronald’s house were they,</p>
<p class="verse0">For to perform the enterprize,</p>
<p class="verse0">And get clothes fit for his disguise.</p>
<p class="verse0">By a party of militia men,</p>
<p class="verse0">Both of them prisoners were ta’en,</p>
<p class="verse0">Miss ask’d who was their officer,</p>
<p class="verse0">And they in answer told it her:</p>
<p class="verse0">He prov’d her father-in-law to be,</p>
<p class="verse0">Preferr’d, for suppos’d loyaltie,</p>
<p class="verse0">No less than a king’s officer,</p>
<p class="verse0">She thought she might the better fare,</p>
<p class="verse0">And there did tarry all that night,</p>
<p class="verse0">Before of him she got a sight.</p>
<p class="verse0">Greatly surprized then was he,</p>
<p class="verse0">His step-daughter prisoner to see,</p>
<p class="verse0">Call’d her aside to know the matter,</p>
<p class="verse0">And gave her both a pass and letter,</p>
<p class="verse0">For herself, her lad, and Betty Burke,</p>
<p class="verse0">A woman who was to spin and work,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being a maid for her mother hir’d</p>
<p class="verse0">So all was done as she requir’d.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Then to Clan Ronald’s house they came,</p>
<p class="verse0">And let the lady know the same,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where ev’ry thing in haste was got,</p>
<p class="verse0">Apron, gown, and a petticoat:</p>
<p class="verse0">Of printed cotton the gown it was,</p>
<p class="verse0">Just fitting for a servant lass:</p>
<p class="verse0">Then to the hut they went away,</p>
<p class="verse0">To get him drest without delay;</p>
<p class="verse0">And as they entred into the door</p>
<p class="verse0">They found their Prince, surpriz’d him sore,</p>
<p class="verse0">A cooking something for to eat,</p>
<p class="verse0">A sheep’s pluck on a wooden spit.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">This put them all in Brinish tears,</p>
<p class="verse0">A Prince brought to such low affairs!</p>
<p class="verse0">But he reply’d, Why weep ye so?</p>
<p class="verse0">’Tis good for Kings sorrow to know:</p>
<p class="verse0">And ev’n the great, won’t after rue,</p>
<p class="verse0">They suffer’d part of what I do.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">That night they stayed all in the hut,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ere ev’ry thing was ready got,</p>
<p class="verse0">And on the morrow a message came</p>
<p class="verse0">For lady Clan-Ronald, in haste extreme,</p>
<p class="verse0">That cap. Ferguson, with Campbell’s men,</p>
<p class="verse0">Did all night in her house remain.</p>
<p class="verse0">And to confirm what they had said,</p>
<p class="verse0">The Captain took up her own bed.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Now Charles by this time was drest,</p>
<p class="verse0">Like a Dutch frow, I do protest,</p>
<p class="verse0">His <em>brogues</em>, indeed, had leather heels,</p>
<p class="verse0">And beard, well shaven, all conceals;</p>
<p class="verse0">But gown and petticoat so short,</p>
<p class="verse0">Shew’d too much legs, but no help for’t.</p>
<p class="verse0">He of the lady took his leave,</p>
<p class="verse0">And left O’Neil behind to grieve,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who thro’ the world with him would go;</p>
<p class="verse0">But Flora said it would not do:</p>
<p class="verse0">Because their pass that number bore,</p>
<p class="verse0">And one too much was not secure,</p>
<p class="verse0">Herself, her servant, and Betty Burke,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who was going to her mother’s work.</p>
<p class="verse0">The boat’s prepar’d, away they set;</p>
<p class="verse0">But lady Clan-Ronald was in a strait:</p>

<p class="verse0">Was strict examin’d by Ferguson&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">Pray where now, Madam, have you been,</p>
<p class="verse0">Seeing a sick child, a dying frien’;</p>
<p class="verse0">My servants might have told the matter;</p>

<p class="verse0">So he put them both on board of ships,</p>
<p class="verse0">I mean Clan-Ronald and his dame,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who did in sep’rate ships remain,</p>
<p class="verse0">Until to London they were sent,</p>

<p class="verse2">Now poor O’Neil was left alone,</p>

<p class="verse0">By chance he met with Sullivan;</p>
<p class="verse0">As on the shore they both did stan’</p>
<p class="verse0">A French cutter came in their sight,</p>
<p class="verse0">With pendent flying, colours bright,</p>
<p class="verse0">O’Neil her hail’d, and to she came,</p>
<p class="verse0">To <em>fetch</em> the Prince was all her aim.</p>
<p class="verse0">O’Neil desir’d them there to stay,</p>
<p class="verse0">And he to bring him back wou’d try:</p>
<p class="verse0">Then off he sets along the shore,</p>
<p class="verse0">A trav’lling for a day or more,</p>
<p class="verse0">As the wind had contrary been,</p>
<p class="verse0">Into some creek they might be seen:</p>
<p class="verse0">But finding he was gone for Sky,</p>
<p class="verse0">He thought to touch there going by,</p>
<p class="verse0">Knowing the secret, the way plann’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">The very place he was to land.</p>
<p class="verse0">Night and day he did not spare,</p>
<p class="verse0">Back to the cutter he did repair;</p>
<p class="verse0">But ere he came she was away,</p>
<p class="verse0">Sullivan would no longer stay:</p>
<p class="verse0">For’s life was preciouser to him,</p>
<p class="verse0">Than all the princes in Christendom.</p>
<p class="verse0">He saw some ships afar at sea,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then pray’d the French with him to flee:</p>
<p class="verse0">But had they got O’Neil on board,</p>
<p class="verse0">From Sky the Prince had been secur’d;</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet here O’Neil was left behind,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who soon was taken and confin’d,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">And sent to Berwick upon Tweed,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where he remain’d some time indeed,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thence by cartel was sent to France</p>
<p class="verse0">Pass’d for an officer from thence.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Sullivan was got home before him,</p>
<p class="verse0">The cow’rdliest cur in all the <em>quorum</em>:</p>
<p class="verse0">For had he staid three hours in Uist,</p>
<p class="verse0">They’d carry’d their Prince safe off the coast:</p>
<p class="verse0">For O’Neil would made them touch at Sky,</p>
<p class="verse0">The very place which they past by,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where he knew the Prince was to ’bide:</p>
<p class="verse0">But Sullivan sav’d his own hide,</p>

<p class="verse2">As the Prince, Miss Flora and her man,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were just about to quit the land,</p>
<p class="verse0">Four king’s wherries came in their view,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where armed men were not a few:</p>
<p class="verse0">Back to the heather they’re forc’d to fly,</p>
<p class="verse0">And there some time conceal’d to ly,</p>
<p class="verse0">These wherries soon went out of sight,</p>
<p class="verse0">And then came on a pleasant night,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their boat ready they put to sea;</p>
<p class="verse0">But were not gone past leagues three,</p>
<p class="verse0">’Till dark and dismal grew the skies,</p>
<p class="verse0">The wind and waves did dreadful rise,</p>
<p class="verse0">In open boat, no compass had,</p>
<p class="verse0">Only two men, whose skill was bad.</p>
<p class="verse0">Here Charles’ courage was at a stand,</p>
<p class="verse0">Tempests by sea and storms by land;</p>
<p class="verse0">For wind and wave did fight again’ him</p>
<p class="verse0">And nothing seemed to befrien’ him.</p>
<p class="verse0">Miss Flora she fell fast asleep,</p>
<p class="verse0">The rest by oars and helm did keep,</p>
<p class="verse0">And when the day light did appear,</p>
<p class="verse0">They knew not to what hand to steer,</p>
<p class="verse0">The wind had vary’d in the night:</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">At last of Sky they got a sight.</p>
<p class="verse0">At <em>Waternish</em>, the west of Sky,</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon that point to land did try;</p>
<p class="verse0">But the red-coats were swarming there,</p>
<p class="verse0">To ship about they did prepare:</p>
<p class="verse0">They smartly fir’d to bring ’em too,</p>
<p class="verse0">But all in vain, it would not do.</p>
<p class="verse0">Two men of war were hov’ring by,</p>
<p class="verse0">And there it was no time to stay;</p>
<p class="verse0">So, off they set before the wind,</p>
<p class="verse0">And all their foes they left behind.</p>
<p class="verse0">The alarm up to the village went;</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet to pursue they were not bent,</p>
<p class="verse0">Knowing all boats were in a fright;</p>
<p class="verse0">So about they put when out of sight,</p>
<p class="verse0">And landed in a little creek,</p>
<p class="verse0">Under a rock did shelter seek,</p>
<p class="verse0">The men to rest and be refresh’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who all the night were sorely dash’d:</p>
<p class="verse0">And then to sea again did go,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lest some should of their landing know.</p>
<p class="verse0">They were not half a mile from shore,</p>

<p class="verse0">All running to the very place,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which they had left a little space.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then to the north twelve miles they stood,</p>
<p class="verse0">At <em>Tornish</em> made their landing good.</p>
<p class="verse0">Near Alexander MacDonald’s house,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where went Miss Flora bold and crouse,</p>

<p class="verse0">Only his factor, who prov’d a friend,</p>
<p class="verse0">And how to act Miss to him mean’d:</p>
<p class="verse0">As a military officer was there,</p>
<p class="verse0">She told him where he should repair,</p>
<p class="verse0">And meet the Prince in woman’s dress,</p>
<p class="verse0">To whom he went in full express,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">With bread and wine, and other food,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then took the hills, a private road</p>
<p class="verse0">To his own house to be conceal’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Though afterwards it was reveal’d.</p>
<p class="verse0">Miss Flora on horseback, and another</p>
<p class="verse0">Kept the high-way, for to discover</p>
<p class="verse0">What militia or foes might be;</p>
<p class="verse0">From all dangers to keep him free,</p>
<p class="verse0">Miss Flora, her man, and a Highland maid,</p>
<p class="verse0">Coming on the way, She to Miss said,</p>
<p class="verse0">“That <em>Lawland Carlin gangs</em> like a man,</p>
<p class="verse0">“She strides o’er far by half a span,</p>
<p class="verse0">“I wonder Kingsborough’s not afraid,</p>
<p class="verse0">“To crack sae wi’ that English jade:</p>
<p class="verse0">“See how her coats <em>wamels</em> again,</p>
<p class="verse0">“These English women can fight like men.”</p>
<p class="verse0">No, said Miss, She’s an Irish woman:</p>
<p class="verse0">Cries, Lady Marg’ret, Are you coming?</p>
<p class="verse0">(Not liking what the girl had said)</p>
<p class="verse0">Go after Kingsborough yon road,</p>
<p class="verse0">And you’ll be there as soon as we,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thus she kept him from suspicion free;</p>
<p class="verse0">And to the house they came at last</p>
<p class="verse0">Before elev’n o’clock was past.</p>
<p class="verse0">But Kingsb’ro’s wife was gone to bed,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thinking that no such stranger wad,</p>
<p class="verse0">At such a time come to her door:</p>
<p class="verse0">For th’ two young ladies were oft before.</p>
<p class="verse0">She sent them word to take the key,</p>
<p class="verse0">With all in the house for to make free;</p>
<p class="verse0">But Kingsbro’ said that would not do,</p>
<p class="verse0">Herself must rise, and quickly too.</p>
<p class="verse0">The child ran back and told her plain,</p>
<p class="verse0">Such a lang wife she ne’er saw nane,</p>
<p class="verse0">As that was walking through the ha’,</p>
<p class="verse0">Her like was never there awa’,</p>
<p class="verse0">Therefore she’d go no more for fear,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Then up she rose and did appear:</p>
<p class="verse0">And the one who walked through the hall,</p>
<p class="verse0">Did her salute and kiss with all,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whereat she started and was afraid,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being so prick’d with a lady’s beard:</p>
<p class="verse0">Then to her husband said, whisp’ring ways,</p>
<p class="verse0">Is not this a gentleman in disguise?</p>
<p class="verse0">His pricking beard does me convince,</p>
<p class="verse0">Pray ask him, What’s come of the Prince?</p>
<p class="verse0">The Prince, my dear, Why this is he&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">Oh, said she, then we’ll hanged be&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">A well, said he, We’ll die but once,</p>
<p class="verse0">Get supper for him, cakes and scones,</p>
<p class="verse0">Butter and cheese, we have eggs enow:</p>
<p class="verse0">What! That for a Prince will never do.</p>
<p class="verse0">Yes, for rarities be nowise griev’d;</p>
<p class="verse0">You little know how he has liv’d:</p>
<p class="verse0">And with ceremony be not affected,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lest by your servants he be suspected,</p>
<p class="verse0">He supp’d that night and went to sleep</p>
<p class="verse0">As a stranger lady, all snug was kept.</p>
<p class="verse0">On the morrow he rose and was drest,</p>
<p class="verse0">And for their kindness thanks exprest:</p>
<p class="verse0">Miss Flora and the other Miss,</p>
<p class="verse0">They had him in his robes to dress,</p>
<p class="verse0">The gown, the <em>mutch</em>, and petticoat,</p>
<p class="verse0">Such stuff to wear he loved not;</p>
<p class="verse0">But because to them in such he came,</p>
<p class="verse0">He should go off wearing the same,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lest by enquiry they might provoke</p>
<p class="verse0">What they were, being stranger folk.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then Kingsborough’s wife did them desire,</p>
<p class="verse0">To ask a <em>pickle</em> of his hair.</p>
<p class="verse0">And they in <em>Galick</em> did debate,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who should it ask, they were so blate:</p>
<p class="verse0">He understood, the reason <em>speir’d</em></p>
<p class="verse0">Of their debate, desir’d to hear’t,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">This freely granted as soon as told,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to their sheers his head did hold,</p>
<p class="verse0">The lock was parted ’mongst the three,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of their dear Prince mindful to be,</p>
<p class="verse0">An ancient <em>freit</em>, a Highland <em>charm</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">Look on that hair her heart will <em>warm</em>.</p>
<p class="verse0">Kingsb’rough a bundle of men’ clothes took</p>
<p class="verse0">Far from his house, to a wood <em>nuik</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">Remounted him in Highland dress,</p>
<p class="verse0">There he much kindness did express&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">They wept, they kiss’d, and off he goes,</p>
<p class="verse0">While drops of blood fell from his nose.</p>
<p class="verse0">Their hearts were great, you may weel <em>ken</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">They parted ne’er to meet again.</p>
<p class="verse0">A guide sent wi’m the mountain way,</p>
<p class="verse0">Had a boat ready, the freight did pay,</p>
<p class="verse0">At <em>Portree</em>, or the king’s port,</p>
<p class="verse0">Miss Flora’s there ere he came to’t.</p>
<p class="verse0">And here they parted at Portree,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where thanking her most heartilie,</p>
<p class="verse0">Miss Flora did no longer wait;</p>
<p class="verse0">But went to ’r mother’s house at <em>Slate</em>.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Now Kingsborough did Raaza send</p>
<p class="verse0">To meet the Prince, and be his friend,</p>
<p class="verse0">With sev’ral of his trusties there,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who in his expeditions were,</p>
<p class="verse0">Both at Culloden and Falkirk.</p>
<p class="verse0">To <em>Portree</em> came when it was dark,</p>
<p class="verse0">Both John MacKenzie and Donald Frier,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who had been with him far and near,</p>
<p class="verse0">They set off in a little boat,</p>
<p class="verse0">And safely into <em>Glam</em> all got:</p>
<p class="verse0">In a mean hut their dwelling made,</p>
<p class="verse0">For kid and lamb young Raaza <em>gade</em>:</p>
<p class="verse0">There was no bedding to be found,</p>
<p class="verse0">They’re oblig’d to lie upon the ground:</p>
<p class="verse0">His pillow was a <em>wisp</em> of Ling:</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Poor state for a pretended king!</p>
<p class="verse0">This was in July the first day,</p>
<p class="verse0">And here <em>incog.</em> some time they lay.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Now Ferguson got the sure tract</p>
<p class="verse0">From the two men, as they went back,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who did him and Miss Flora bring</p>
<p class="verse0">Out of Uist, and everything,</p>
<p class="verse0">His coat, his <em>mutch</em>, his very gown,</p>
<p class="verse0">From whence they came, and whither boun’,</p>
<p class="verse0">How Malton’s daughter and Kingsborough too,</p>
<p class="verse0">Went all together out of their view.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then Ferg’son with a party came</p>
<p class="verse0">To Kingsb’ro’s house, and did deman’,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which way the young Pretender went?</p>
<p class="verse0">Where he and Miss Flora were sent?</p>
<p class="verse0">Whether they lay in one bed together?</p>
<p class="verse0">What clothes he came in, or went thither?</p>
<p class="verse0">Few answers to him Kingsb’rough made:</p>
<p class="verse0">What! said his wife, “Miss Flora’s maid,</p>
<p class="verse0">“They staid all night and went away,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Whether man or woman was I to try?”</p>
<p class="verse0">Then, said he, Show where they were laid,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where lay the Miss? where lay the maid?</p>
<p class="verse0">Now then, quoth he, I have you fast:</p>
<p class="verse0">Because the maid’s bed is the best.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then Kingsborough away was led</p>
<p class="verse0">To Fort-Augustus, hard bestead,</p>
<p class="verse0">Plunder’d of’s watch, buckles and shoes,</p>
<p class="verse0">And all the cash was in his trews,</p>
<p class="verse0">In a dungeon deep, iron’d he lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thence to Ed’nburgh castle sent away,</p>
<p class="verse0">And there confin’d was kept one year,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till by the Act of Grace set clear.</p>
<p class="verse0">For love of Charlie he got this,</p>
<p class="verse0">And poor Miss Flora no better was:</p>
<p class="verse0">For she was scarce ten days at home,</p>
<p class="verse0">Until she got a card to come</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">And speak unto an officer,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who had no great good will to her:</p>
<p class="verse0">This for a night she did delay,</p>
<p class="verse0">And on the morrow, by the way,</p>
<p class="verse0">A party meets, in search of her,</p>
<p class="verse0">By whom she was made prisoner,</p>
<p class="verse0">And carry’d instantly away,</p>
<p class="verse0">On board a ship that very day,</p>
<p class="verse0">The Furnace, captain Ferguson,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who did show lenity to none.</p>
<p class="verse0">But good for her, as fortunes were,</p>
<p class="verse0">That gen’ral Campbell, as judge sat there:</p>
<p class="verse0">Though she before made ’quivocation,</p>
<p class="verse0">She told to him the true relation,</p>
<p class="verse0">And the general did use her well,</p>
<p class="verse0">Since she the truth did not conceal:</p>
<p class="verse0">For of the deed she thought no shame,</p>
<p class="verse0">To any in need she’d do the same.</p>
<p class="verse0">Said she, “I’ve no cause to betray,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Or yet to wish his life away,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Wherefore then should I do him wrong?</p>
<p class="verse0">“To you soldiers does such belong.</p>
<p class="verse0">“If that a price be on his head?</p>
<p class="verse0">“’Tis for those by blood who have their bread.”</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">The gen’ral then had nought to say;</p>
<p class="verse0">But gave her leave, on the next day,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of her friends to go and take farewel;</p>
<p class="verse0">Her mother heart-sore grief did feel:</p>
<p class="verse0">An officer and forty men</p>
<p class="verse0">Did guard her there, and back again.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then she unto the <em>Nore</em> was sent,</p>
<p class="verse0">Five months on sea, where no friend <em>kent</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">At last to London was convey’d,</p>

<p class="verse2">Now Charles at Glam, in Raaza lay,</p>

<p class="verse0">Hard was his living, poor his hut,</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon all heights they watches put.</p>
<p class="verse0">A stranger to this island came</p>
<p class="verse0">To sell tobacco, perhaps a sham;</p>
<p class="verse0">For after all his roll was sold,</p>
<p class="verse0">He daily through the island stroll’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to the hut one day drew nigh;</p>
<p class="verse0">Then Raaza swore he was a spy,</p>

<p class="verse0">That poor man may innocent be,</p>
<p class="verse0">Without a fault he shall not die.</p>

<p class="verse0">Now, said the Prince, what would ye said,</p>

<p class="verse0">Too much, indeed, on my account:</p>
<p class="verse0">At this some seem’d to take affront;</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet as a joke he past it by,</p>
<p class="verse0">And then propos’d to go for Sky,</p>

<p class="verse0">No man will die but him that’s <em>fey</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">We’ve all in dangers been ere now:</p>

<p class="verse0">Near <em>Scorebreck</em> in <em>Trotternish</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their lodging in a byre it was,</p>
<p class="verse0">All wet and weary as they were,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lay on the ground, sleep seiz’d him there,</p>
<p class="verse0">In which he sigh’d, and starting said,</p>

<p class="verse0">A napkin ty’d around his head,</p>
<p class="verse0">In this posture forward they <em>gade</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">Long thirty miles ere they took rest,</p>
<p class="verse0">Water and brandy was all their feast:</p>
<p class="verse0">Because they had no other cheer,</p>
<p class="verse0">For house or hut they went not near,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till at <em>Ellighill</em>, the place call’d Ord,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whereof MacKinnon is the lord,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their brandy-bottle now was done,</p>
<p class="verse0">And here they hid it under groun’:</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet were they in a strait again,</p>
<p class="verse0">Meeting two of MacKinnon’s men,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who had on the expedition been,</p>
<p class="verse0">And oft before the Prince had seen,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who knew him well, though in disguise,</p>
<p class="verse0">Fell down and bursted out in cries.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then Malcom, Hush, to them did call,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or else they would discover all,</p>
<p class="verse0">To which they swore, by all that’s Good,</p>
<p class="verse0">They’d rather spend their dearest blood,</p>
<p class="verse0">So faithfully they did conceal it,</p>
<p class="verse0">And did not in the least reveal it.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Now were they come unto the place,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where Malcom’s sister married was</p>
<p class="verse0">To John MacKinnon, who’d captain been</p>
<p class="verse0">Along with Charles in armour <em>keen</em>;</p>
<p class="verse0">But had got clear by Proclamation,</p>
<p class="verse0">And for to skulk had no occasion.</p>
<p class="verse0">He orders the Prince, now Lewis Cawe,</p>
<p class="verse0">For to ly down some space awa’,</p>
<p class="verse0">While he into his sister’s went,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their doleful case to represent.</p>
<p class="verse0">She him embrac’d, and wept amain,</p>
<p class="verse0">As in the war she thought him slain:</p>
<p class="verse0">He said, dear sister, here I’m come</p>
<p class="verse0">Myself to hide, if you have room,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">With one, my servant, Lewis Cawe,</p>
<p class="verse0">In the same case, hard is our fa’:</p>
<p class="verse0">He’s a surgeon’s son, who came from Crief</p>
<p class="verse0">Shelter to seek and some relief.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then poor sick Lewis was called in,</p>
<p class="verse0">With head bound up, he look’d right grim,</p>
<p class="verse0">And by his master there he did stand,</p>
<p class="verse0">With head uncover’d, bonnet in hand:</p>
<p class="verse0">But the Captain urg’d him to sit down,</p>
<p class="verse0">And put his bonnet on his crown,</p>
<p class="verse0">Since there are no strangers here,</p>
<p class="verse0">Come, eat with me, Lewis, my dear.</p>
<p class="verse0">And when their dinner over was,</p>
<p class="verse0">The Captain says, Our feet we’ll wash:</p>
<p class="verse0">The servant-maid brought water then,</p>
<p class="verse0">And wash’d his feet with tender han’.</p>
<p class="verse0">Said he, my lad’s not well, I know,</p>
<p class="verse0">You’ll wash his feet before you go;</p>
<p class="verse0">But she reply’d, I <em>ken</em> some better,</p>
<p class="verse0">’Tis fair enough if I bring water,</p>
<p class="verse0">He’s but your lad, as you me tell,</p>
<p class="verse0"><em>Dat loon may wash her feet hersel</em>;</p>
<p class="verse0">Being forc’d to do’t, through mere constraint,</p>
<p class="verse0">To work in a rude way she went,</p>
<p class="verse0">Rubbed his toes, made the water rise</p>
<p class="verse0">At every plash, betwixt his thighs;</p>
<p class="verse0">On this he to the Captain said,</p>
<p class="verse0">She rubs too hard this saucy maid,</p>
<p class="verse0">I had far better do’t mysell,</p>
<p class="verse0"><em>In trout</em>, quo’ she, <em>an sae ye sall</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then both of them to sleep were put,</p>
<p class="verse0">The goodwife went to a hill-top</p>
<p class="verse0">For to keep watch, lest from the sea</p>
<p class="verse0">Incursions should come suddenlie.</p>
<p class="verse0">As King’s ships hover’d all about,</p>
<p class="verse0">And parties through the land did scout.</p>
<p class="verse0">Just as they wak’d the husband came,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">When Malcom heard, he to him ran,</p>
<p class="verse0">And did salute him in the field,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which meeting did great pleasure yield;</p>
<p class="verse0">Because that word was to them brought,</p>
<p class="verse0">He kill’d was at Culloden fight.</p>
<p class="verse0">And after they had talk’d a while,</p>
<p class="verse0">Think you yon ships will touch this isle?</p>
<p class="verse0">Says John, I know not but they might;</p>
<p class="verse0">Because they’re never out of sight.</p>
<p class="verse0">What if our Prince a pris’ner be,</p>
<p class="verse0">In one of those ships which we see?</p>
<p class="verse0">God forbid, then John reply’d;</p>
<p class="verse0">But of his ’scape I’m much afraid:</p>
<p class="verse0">For our nation’s guarded round about,</p>
<p class="verse0">And through the land there’s many a scout.</p>
<p class="verse0">But do you think, if he were here,</p>
<p class="verse0">He would be safe, in such a stir?</p>
<p class="verse0">Ay, safe be sure, whate’er they do,</p>
<p class="verse0">I wish we had him here just now.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then said he, John, he’s in your house;</p>
<p class="verse0">But to salute him, be cautious:</p>
<p class="verse0">Because your wife, nor none else knows,</p>
<p class="verse0">By the name of Lewis Cawe he goes,</p>
<p class="verse0">My servant, a surgeon’s son in Crief,</p>
<p class="verse0">Like us, brought to trouble and grief:</p>
<p class="verse0">Therefore behave when in you go,</p>
<p class="verse0">That none within the house may know.</p>
<p class="verse0">So home they came, and in he goes,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then courteously poor Lewis rose,</p>
<p class="verse0">Bare-headed stood, bonnet in hand,</p>
<p class="verse0">But John could not himself command,</p>
<p class="verse0">Burst out in tears, and on him flew,</p>
<p class="verse0">Oh-hon, Oh-hon, What’s this on you!</p>
<p class="verse0">From splendor into deep distress!</p>
<p class="verse0">He cry’d, and could no more express.</p>
<p class="verse0">Wife and servants stood in amaze,</p>
<p class="verse0">And did upon poor Lewis gaze:</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Then Malcom in a passion flew,</p>
<p class="verse0">And swore that he had fools enow,</p>
<p class="verse0">Hurry’d them to another place,</p>
<p class="verse0">And told his sister all the case,</p>
<p class="verse0">That he and poor Lewis was in,</p>
<p class="verse0">Charged her forthwith for to run,</p>
<p class="verse0">And bind her servants to secresie,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or else they soon would ruin’d be.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">When his sister knew what guest he was,</p>
<p class="verse0">Her kindness she did the more express,</p>
<p class="verse0">And said, Upon her very knees</p>
<p class="verse0">She’d travel for to give him ease.</p>
<p class="verse0">They then to consultation went,</p>
<p class="verse0">To get him to the Continent:</p>
<p class="verse0">Because the isles were dangerous,</p>
<p class="verse0">Soldiers searching every bush.</p>
<p class="verse0">John then unto the laird he went,</p>
<p class="verse0">To try how his affection bent,</p>
<p class="verse0">By long-wind stories laments his case,</p>
<p class="verse0">In being hunted from place to place.</p>
<p class="verse0">Oh, said the laird, were he now here,</p>
<p class="verse0">I’d lay my life to get him clear,</p>
<p class="verse0">And set him safe on the main land.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then John he told him, clean off hand,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where he was, and in what place,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to his conscience left his case.</p>
<p class="verse0">Go tell him, I’ll be with him soon,</p>
<p class="verse0">To see what quickly shall be done.</p>
<p class="verse0">John went home, the laird soon came,</p>
<p class="verse0">With loyal affections, as chief o’s Clan,</p>
<p class="verse0">And told, that for him he did provide</p>
<p class="verse0">A good stout boat, pilot and guide,</p>
<p class="verse0">That he himself design’d to go</p>
<p class="verse0">To the main land with him also,</p>
<p class="verse0">A thousand blessings on him prays,</p>
<p class="verse0">And wish’d him long and happy days.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Then Malcom said, he would return,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Which caus’d the Prince in tears to mourn:</p>
<p class="verse0">Captain, he said, will you leave me now?</p>
<p class="verse0">On the main land, what shall I do?</p>
<p class="verse0">Then said the laird, leave that to me,</p>
<p class="verse0">On the main land I’ll you supplie.</p>
<p class="verse0">Sir, said Malcom, by now I’m mist</p>
<p class="verse0">By friends, by foes, and this I trust</p>
<p class="verse0">For to be ta’en, when I return,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then I’ll tell a tale of my sojourn,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of all my travels how I was here,</p>
<p class="verse0">Seeing my friends and sister dear;</p>
<p class="verse0">But if they chance us to pursue,</p>
<p class="verse0">They’ll hear of me along with you:</p>
<p class="verse0">For answer then, what could I say?</p>
<p class="verse0">What man ye was, or gone what way?</p>
<p class="verse0">Which accordingly it came to pass:</p>
<p class="verse0">For he twelve months confined was,</p>
<p class="verse0">And saw great London for the same,</p>
<p class="verse0">There try’d and came with Flora <em>hame</em>.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">So to the boat they all did go,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which lay upon the shore below:</p>
<p class="verse0">And as to it they did draw near,</p>
<p class="verse0">Two men of war there did appear,</p>
<p class="verse0">Came cruising in before the wind,</p>
<p class="verse0">Hard on the shore, as they design’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which caused them to sit down a space,</p>
<p class="verse0">And smoak a pipe in a hollow place.</p>
<p class="verse0">A silver stock-buckle to Malcom he <em>geid</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">And ten guineas too in his <em>loof</em> he laid,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which he did often times refuse;</p>
<p class="verse0">But begg’d some trifle that he did use;</p>
<p class="verse0">Then, said he, Captain, Your pay’s too cheap,</p>
<p class="verse0">Besides, you will have my cutty pipe,</p>
<p class="verse0">And when you blow’t, you’ll think on me,</p>
<p class="verse0">As I have got another you see:</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Now, the men of war being out of sight,</p>
<p class="verse0">On the eighth of July, at eight at night,</p>
<p class="verse0">The laird of MacKinnon, John by name,</p>
<p class="verse0">With a pilot, guide, and four boat-men,</p>
<p class="verse0">All on board with him they went,</p>
<p class="verse0">To carry him to the Continent.</p>
<p class="verse0">The night indeed was fair and clear;</p>
<p class="verse0">But not above a mile they were,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till wind and waves did rise in ire,</p>
<p class="verse0">This providence we may admire,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which seemed to be frowning on him,</p>
<p class="verse0">The very waves striving to drown him,</p>
<p class="verse0">And on their boat, came straight a-head,</p>
<p class="verse0">A boat with men all well armed:</p>
<p class="verse0">But the sea was high, the wind so blew,</p>
<p class="verse0">And nought but present death in view,</p>
<p class="verse0">They hail’d each other, and that was all,</p>
<p class="verse0">It was no time to search or call:</p>
<p class="verse0">Had not this storm proved their frien’,</p>
<p class="verse0">He’d surely in their clutches been.</p>
<p class="verse0">And when they reached the main land,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Under the <em>lee</em> they’re forc’d to stand,</p>
<p class="verse0">The pilot ran her into a creek,</p>
<p class="verse0">Got past the breakers, ’mong sand and <em>sleik</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">There they landed him and his guide,</p>
<p class="verse0">And chus’d no longer to abide:</p>
<p class="verse0">But to the sea again did go;</p>
<p class="verse0">Because the storm did fiercely blow.</p>
<p class="verse0">And as they were returning back,</p>
<p class="verse0">A boat from <em>Morar</em> did them ’ttack;</p>
<p class="verse0">And old MacKinnon was pris’ner made,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being, by direction, to him led,</p>
<p class="verse0">By a party who did the two pursue,</p>
<p class="verse0">And the boat who of them had a view</p>
<p class="verse0">The night before, when going over:</p>
<p class="verse0">The facts of all they could discover,</p>
<p class="verse0">At <em>Morar</em>, on his going back,</p>
<p class="verse0">The laird MacKinnon they did take,</p>
<p class="verse0">And prov’d the deed which he had done,</p>
<p class="verse0">For which they sent him to London.</p>
<p class="verse0">In Southwark goal long did he ly,</p>
<p class="verse0">With heavy fetters did him ty,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till in Forty Seven, the next year</p>
<p class="verse0">By Act of Grace he got home clear.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Now Charlie went to Glen-Brasdale,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where he heard tell of brave Lochiel,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who about Loch-aber was lurking there;</p>
<p class="verse0">But to get to him great dangers were:</p>
<p class="verse0">As a line was form’d from Inverness,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which reached to Fort-Augustus,</p>
<p class="verse0">From thence unto Fort-William again,</p>
<p class="verse0">Night and day stood armed men.</p>
<p class="verse0">The word, in a few minutes, did wheel,</p>
<p class="verse0">From end to end, <em>All is well</em>;</p>
<p class="verse0">And from Fort-William to Locharkaig-head,</p>
<p class="verse0">Another line was likewise made.</p>
<p class="verse0">Thus he did in Glen-Brasdale ly,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till circled almost every way.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Gen’ral Campbell with four hundred men,</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon the south-west side did land:</p>
<p class="verse0">Captain Scot, with five hundred more,</p>
<p class="verse0">Advancing from the easter shore,</p>
<p class="verse0">And came within two miles of way,</p>
<p class="verse0">They knew not what to do or say:</p>
<p class="verse0">He sent for Cam’ron of Glen-Pan,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who chus’d to be his guide and van,</p>
<p class="verse0">To Lovat’s country for to go,</p>
<p class="verse0">The braes of Locharkaig as he did know,</p>
<p class="verse0">With them went Glenaladale and his brother,</p>
<p class="verse0">Boradale’s two boys, there was no other:</p>
<p class="verse0">First went the guide on’s hands and knees,</p>
<p class="verse0">After past the Prince and the two boys,</p>
<p class="verse0">Glenaladale and his brother at last,</p>
<p class="verse0">Favour’d by the night, they quietly past</p>
<p class="verse0">So near their tents they heard their speech,</p>
<p class="verse0">And ere day, got far out of reach,</p>
<p class="verse0">Right safe into Glen-Morriston,</p>
<p class="verse0">Left Glenaladale and him alone.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">One day, as they a travelling were,</p>
<p class="verse0">Over a desart mountain there,</p>
<p class="verse0">Glenaladale chanc’d to lose his purse,</p>
<p class="verse0">With forty guineas which in it was,</p>
<p class="verse0">And money behind it they had none,</p>
<p class="verse0">The Prince’s being spent and gone.</p>
<p class="verse0">While Glen. return’d his purse to seek,</p>
<p class="verse0">Charlie lay down at a bush <em>cheek</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">And there appear’d unto his view,</p>
<p class="verse0">A band of soldiers not a few,</p>
<p class="verse0">Just upon that very spot</p>
<p class="verse0">Where they had met, were’t not the lot</p>
<p class="verse0">Of turning for that very purse</p>
<p class="verse0">Kept them from what had been much worse.</p>
<p class="verse0">So, close he lay, slie as a tod,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being at some distance from the road,</p>
<p class="verse0">And saw them take another rout,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">That they’d met Glen. he had no doubt,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being gone quite the contrary way</p>
<p class="verse0">For which he thankfully did pray.</p>
<p class="verse0">Glen. found his purse and turn’d again,</p>
<p class="verse0">They chang’d their rout through a wild glen,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where nothing had they for to eat,</p>
<p class="verse0">Full forty hours they wanted meat:</p>
<p class="verse0">Weak and weary were they both,</p>
<p class="verse0">Water indeed they had enough;</p>
<p class="verse0">But found no sheep or venison,</p>
<p class="verse0">The cattle being plund’red and gone.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">At last, they chanced for to spy</p>
<p class="verse0">A little smoking hut, near by:</p>
<p class="verse0">Then said the Prince, Thither I’ll go,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whether they should prove friend or foe:</p>
<p class="verse0">Better for us be kill’d like men,</p>
<p class="verse0">Than starved like fools: What say’st thou Glen?</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet Glen refus’d, and said, I fear,</p>
<p class="verse0">They may be King’s-men watching here:</p>
<p class="verse0">But in the Prince goes to the hut,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which them in some confusion put;</p>
<p class="verse0">Six sturdy thieves resided there,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who at their dinner sitting were,</p>
<p class="verse0">At a weighty piece of boiled beef,</p>
<p class="verse0">For hungry men a blest relief.</p>
<p class="verse0">Peace be here, the Prince did cry,</p>
<p class="verse0">You’re welcome, sir, they did reply;</p>
<p class="verse0">One star’d at him, then up he flew,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ah Dougal MacColony, is this you?</p>
<p class="verse0">I’m glad to see thee, with all my heart,</p>
<p class="verse0">Sit down with us and take a part.</p>
<p class="verse0">By winks, he found that he was known,</p>
<p class="verse0">Return’d him thanks, and then sat down,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ate hearty, and seem’d very merry,</p>
<p class="verse0">Talk’d of the times, found by enquiry,</p>
<p class="verse0">That ev’ry one spake as his frien’,</p>
<p class="verse0">And had all at Culloden been;</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">But only one of them him knew,</p>
<p class="verse0">He then bethought him what to do,</p>
<p class="verse0">And after dinner they took a walk,</p>
<p class="verse0">With that same man to have some talk,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who told him all the strengths about,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where parties lay, and what to doubt.</p>
<p class="verse0">And as, said he, “The other five,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Are as faithful fellows as alive,</p>
<p class="verse0">“You may your safety to them trust,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Your case by them’s lamented most.</p>
<p class="verse0">“Here do we all in private stay,</p>
<p class="verse0">“And make incursions for our prey:</p>
<p class="verse0">“For meat and drink we do not want,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Of silver and gold we are not scant:</p>
<p class="verse0">“And since ’tis such a roaring time,</p>
<p class="verse0">“To steal and rob we think no crime.”</p>
<p class="verse0">The other five were call’d and told,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who did rejoice him to behold,</p>
<p class="verse0">And swore that he should with them stay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till he found it safe to get away.</p>
<p class="verse0">’Tween Strath-Ferrar and Glen-Morr’ston,</p>
<p class="verse0">They kept up huts, yea more than one,</p>
<p class="verse0">And kindly there did entertain him;</p>
<p class="verse0">To the very last they did befrien’ him,</p>
<p class="verse0">And ere that he should taken be,</p>
<p class="verse0">They every man would for him die.</p>
<p class="verse0">While here he liv’d on stollen beef,</p>
<p class="verse0">Right suddenly there came relief:</p>
<p class="verse0">Rod’rick MacKenzie, a merchant-man,</p>
<p class="verse0">At Ed’nburgh town had join’d the Clan,</p>
<p class="verse0">Had in the expedition been,</p>
<p class="verse0">And at this time durst not be seen,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being sculking in Glen-Morriston,</p>
<p class="verse0">Him the soldiers lighted on,</p>
<p class="verse0">Near about the Prince’s age and size,</p>
<p class="verse0">Genteelly drest, in no disguise.</p>
<p class="verse0">In every feature, for’s very face,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Might well be taken in any case,</p>
<p class="verse0">And lest he’d like a dog be hang’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">He chose to die with sword in hand,</p>
<p class="verse0">And round him like a mad-man struck,</p>
<p class="verse0">Vowing alive he’d ne’er be took:</p>
<p class="verse0">Deep wounds he got, and wounds he gave,</p>
<p class="verse0">At last a shot he did receive,</p>
<p class="verse0">And as he fell, them to convince,</p>
<p class="verse0">Cry’d, Ah! Alas! <em>You’ve kill’d your Prince;</em></p>
<p class="verse0"><em>Ye murderers and bloody crew</em></p>
<p class="verse0"><em>You had no orders this to do.</em></p>
<p class="verse0">This did confirm them in the thought,</p>
<p class="verse0">He was the very man they sought:</p>
<p class="verse0">And ere that he was really dead,</p>
<p class="verse0">They forthwith did cut off his head.</p>
<p class="verse0">Scarce took they time the corpse to bury,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being so o’erjoy’d, in such a hurry.</p>
<p class="verse0">To Fort-Augustus they went with speed,</p>
<p class="verse0">Triumphing o’er poor Charlie’s head.</p>
<p class="verse0">All who had seen him, came it to view,</p>
<p class="verse0">And vow’d the face was just and true;</p>
<p class="verse0">The very barber who us’d to shave him,</p>
<p class="verse0">The sim’lar treats seem’d to deceive him:</p>
<p class="verse0">But, said he, wer’t on his body set,</p>
<p class="verse0">And spake, his voice I’ll not forget.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then to the Duke in haste they’re bound,</p>
<p class="verse0">And claim’d the thirty thousand pound.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">The Duke thought now the work was done,</p>
<p class="verse0">When Charlie’s head was to him shown;</p>
<p class="verse0">Call’d in all out upon command,</p>
<p class="verse0">And caus’d the militia to disband;</p>
<p class="verse0">The ships of war went to the south</p>
<p class="verse0">And Charles’ death did pass for truth.</p>
<p class="verse0">He then for London took his rout,</p>
<p class="verse0">On July eighteenth did set out,</p>
<p class="verse0">As brave Culcairn had sent him word</p>
<p class="verse0">Of Lochiel’s death, ev’n as absurd&mdash;&mdash;</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">When plund’ring of Locharkaig isle,</p>
<p class="verse0">He found the grass cut through the pile,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thinking it was some hidden store,</p>
<p class="verse0">He digg’d it up, and found therefore</p>
<p class="verse0">A man’s body, who dy’d of a sore wound,</p>
<p class="verse0">As appeared when they view’d him round;</p>
<p class="verse0">A fine Holland shirt he on him had,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which soon they <em>whirled</em> o’er his head,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being so much used to plunder,</p>
<p class="verse0">To rob the dead thought little wonder,</p>
<p class="verse0">And him they judg’d to be Lochiel,</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet a near friend of his, they tell,</p>
<p class="verse0">One Cameron, son of Callavat,</p>
<p class="verse0">After which Lochiel no hunting gat,</p>
<p class="verse0">Supposing him and Charlie dead,</p>
<p class="verse0">Though it was two others in their stead.</p>
<p class="verse0">So all the parties far and near,</p>
<p class="verse0">To Fort-Augustus did retire:</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet some of them were soon sent back</p>
<p class="verse0">To burn and plunder, and to take</p>
<p class="verse0">Some great offenders, as Barrisdale,</p>
<p class="verse0">In which attempts they oft did fail:</p>
<p class="verse0">For although the Duke’s to London gone,</p>
<p class="verse0">Burning and plunder still went on.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Now, the Prince into Loch-aber went,</p>
<p class="verse0">The seat of Lochiel, where he was bent</p>
<p class="verse0">To know if he in life might be,</p>
<p class="verse0">As word of’s death o’er all did flee,</p>
<p class="verse0">And the Prince’s death so struck Lochiel,</p>
<p class="verse0">That neither did bemoan himsel;</p>
<p class="verse0">But each lamented for the other,</p>
<p class="verse0">And wept as one would for a mother:</p>
<p class="verse0">But when they heard both were alive,</p>
<p class="verse0">To meet in haste they did contrive,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being only twenty miles between,</p>
<p class="verse0">His brother, the doctor, did them conveen,</p>
<p class="verse0">With the other brother, John the priest,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Who had sincerely been in quest,</p>
<p class="verse0">Through many a mountain, wood and glen,</p>
<p class="verse0">And found him out with eager pain,</p>
<p class="verse0">Into a hut, built in a wood,</p>
<p class="verse0">Near Achnasual where it stood.</p>
<p class="verse0">Charles at a distance did them spy,</p>
<p class="verse0">Made him and Achnasual fly,</p>
<p class="verse0">Not knowing what kind of men they were,</p>
<p class="verse0">Nor what might be their business there;</p>
<p class="verse0">But being inform’d, soon turn’d again,</p>
<p class="verse0">Embrac’d with tears in tender strain,</p>
<p class="verse0">And hearing that Lochiel was well,</p>
<p class="verse0">His heart-felt joy did not conceal.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Prince was now in a poor dress,</p>
<p class="verse0">Poverty’s picture in distress,</p>
<p class="verse0">A black coat with many patches,</p>
<p class="verse0">Barefooted, and wanting breeches,</p>
<p class="verse0">No signs of roy’lty or pride,</p>
<p class="verse0">A durk and pistol by his side,</p>
<p class="verse0">All weather-beaten, his gun in’s hand,</p>
<p class="verse0">Like a Gibeonite, once in Canaan.</p>
<p class="verse0">They had kill’d a cow the day before,</p>
<p class="verse0">Kept a pudding feast, you may be sure,</p>
<p class="verse0">Part of it roast, part of it sodden:</p>
<p class="verse0">But here no bread was to be gotten,</p>
<p class="verse0">No meal nor salt could there be bought;</p>
<p class="verse0">But what’s from Fort-Augustus brought.</p>
<p class="verse0">One man they had was passing free,</p>
<p class="verse0">Came home by chance, <em>right cannilie</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">With a horse-load of provision,</p>
<p class="verse0">Meal and salt, bread and <em>snishen</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">And with him brought a printed News,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which did their whole attentions rouze,</p>
<p class="verse0">How the young Pretender and Lochiel,</p>
<p class="verse0">O’er Corriarick, had pass’d that fell,</p>
<p class="verse0">That they were both alive again,</p>
<p class="verse0">And with them thirty armed men:</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">This caus’d him longer to abide,</p>
<p class="verse0">As safely there he could reside,</p>
<p class="verse0">If a new searching should ensue,</p>
<p class="verse0">His watchmen here were good and true,</p>
<p class="verse0">Dismis’t Glenaladale for home,</p>
<p class="verse0">With the men came from Glen-Morriston,</p>
<p class="verse0">Kept with him only Captain MacRow,</p>
<p class="verse0">Cameron the priest, and other two,</p>
<p class="verse0">With Cluny’s children, they kept the hut,</p>
<p class="verse0">And tour about on watch were put.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">About this time from Dunkirk came</p>
<p class="verse0">Sixty gentlemen, who in a band</p>
<p class="verse0">As volunteers had freely join’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">To bring him from the British ground.</p>
<p class="verse0">At Polliver, in Seaforth’s country,</p>
<p class="verse0">Four of them landed privately,</p>
<p class="verse0">The rest, on sea, kept hov’ring round;</p>
<p class="verse0">And left a signal, how to be found,</p>
<p class="verse0">And where they were for to bring to:</p>
<p class="verse0">These were their orders how to do.</p>
<p class="verse0">Soon after two of them were ta’en,</p>
<p class="verse0">One Fitzgerald, called by name,</p>
<p class="verse0">An officer belong’d to Spain,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was hanged up at Fort-William,</p>
<p class="verse0">Proven to be a Flander’s spy,</p>
<p class="verse0">Judg’d for same end, he came that way.</p>
<p class="verse0">The other was Monsuer de Berards,</p>
<p class="verse0">An officer of the French guards,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who from the gallows was befrien’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">And by cartel again redeem’d.</p>
<p class="verse0">The other two wandered about,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till Lochgarie sent, and found them out;</p>
<p class="verse0">Strangers they seem’d, but who could know</p>
<p class="verse0">Whether that they were friend or foe?</p>
<p class="verse0">Captain MacRow did them invite,</p>
<p class="verse0">At Lochgarie’s with him to meet,</p>
<p class="verse0">To him they plainly did unfold</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">From whence they came, and that they would</p>
<p class="verse0">Fain see the Prince, or yet Lochiel,</p>
<p class="verse0">Having letters to them and words to tell,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or else to one call’d Captain Drummond,</p>
<p class="verse0">And more they would reveal to no man.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Lochgarie judg’d they might be spies,</p>
<p class="verse0">Strove to be cautious and wise,</p>
<p class="verse0">First he sent them to Lochiel,</p>
<p class="verse0">With what suspicion he had himsel:</p>
<p class="verse0">Lochiel order’d the Prince to come in,</p>
<p class="verse0">Under the name of Captain Drummond,</p>
<p class="verse0">As they the Prince did never see,</p>
<p class="verse0">He told them where the two should be,</p>
<p class="verse0">Bade him a letter bring, as from him come,</p>
<p class="verse0">To tell their secrets unto him,</p>
<p class="verse0">And this the Prince actually did,</p>
<p class="verse0">Met in a hut, built in a wood,</p>
<p class="verse0">And kept converse with them a day,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then to meet Lochiel went on his way,</p>
<p class="verse0">For to consult what might be done,</p>
<p class="verse0">Out of Scotland once for to win:</p>
<p class="verse0">For the small ship the Frenchmen left,</p>
<p class="verse0">Quite off the coast were, all abaft,</p>
<p class="verse0">And never did at all appear:</p>
<p class="verse0">But forc’d homeward with dread to steer,</p>
<p class="verse0">And the officers, as I heard tell,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were kept, by orders of Lochiel,</p>
<p class="verse0">Most secretly into a hut,</p>
<p class="verse0">Until a ship was ready got.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">While the Prince yet at Clun’s hut lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">One morning, early of the day,</p>
<p class="verse0">A child of Clun’s came running in,</p>
<p class="verse0">Crying, “O-hon! the red coats and the gun!”</p>
<p class="verse0">Which caus’d them hurry out and see</p>
<p class="verse0">A party coming, and that right nigh:</p>
<p class="verse0">Cluny, John Cameron and his son</p>
<p class="verse0">Into the wood did quickly run.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Clun stood their motions to behold,</p>
<p class="verse0">The others ran to the Prince and told:</p>
<p class="verse0">He sleeping was in another hut,</p>
<p class="verse0">Farther in the wood and more remote;</p>
<p class="verse0">They plainly said, they were surrounded;</p>
<p class="verse0">Then up he rose, no wise confounded,</p>
<p class="verse0">Says he, My lads, review your guns,</p>
<p class="verse0">And let us die like Scotland’s sons,</p>
<p class="verse0">For me, I’ve been a shooter bred,</p>
<p class="verse0">To miss a mark I’m not afraid;</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet we’ll escape them if we may,</p>
<p class="verse0">And live to see a better day.</p>
<p class="verse0">Captain MacRow and Clun’s old son</p>
<p class="verse0">Were in another hut alone,</p>
<p class="verse0">He sent for them, they came with speed,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to the hill did all proceed,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being eight in number, they were no more,</p>
<p class="verse0">Soldiers they saw above five score.</p>
<p class="verse0">But what gave them the most surprise,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was that the soldiers had past their spies,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which they had planted round about,</p>
<p class="verse0">Them to inform of every rout:</p>
<p class="verse0">This caus’d them be the more afraid,</p>
<p class="verse0">And think they surely were betray’d.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then a hill-top they march’d unto,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where of the party they had a view,</p>
<p class="verse0">And all around could no more spy,</p>
<p class="verse0">Than what were of the first party.</p>
<p class="verse0">Next to Mallantagart’s top they flee,</p>
<p class="verse0">High above the braes of Glenkengie;</p>
<p class="verse0">Then Cameron, the priest, and Clun’s son,</p>
<p class="verse0">To make discov’ry did backward run.</p>
<p class="verse0">Two hundred men had gone that way,</p>
<p class="verse0">Headed by Knockardo of Strathspey,</p>
<p class="verse0">A going to plunder Barrisdale,</p>
<p class="verse0">And of Clun’s ten cow’s left not a tail,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which he few days before had bought,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">When burnt his house and left him nought,</p>
<p class="verse0">And yet they thought it was no crime,</p>
<p class="verse0">To plunder him a second time,</p>
<p class="verse0">The very hut they rummaged,</p>
<p class="verse0">Out of which they had lately fled.</p>
<p class="verse0">Clun in the wood all the while lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">And saw them drive his cows away,</p>
<p class="verse0">Until perceiving they were gone,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then he return’d crying, Oh-hon</p>
<p class="verse0">What, Shall I e’er thus plunder’d be?</p>
<p class="verse0">For shelter now, where shall I flee?</p>
<p class="verse0">Went with his son for bread and cheese,</p>
<p class="verse0">Four bottles of whisk they did not seize:</p>
<p class="verse0">His stores all under ground were hid,</p>
<p class="verse0">Cover’d with turff into the wood.</p>
<p class="verse0">Being midnight ere they reach’d the spot,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where Charles lay trembling and wet,</p>
<p class="verse0">They drank the whisk and eat the cheese,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then of the heather made a <em>bleeze</em>.</p>
<p class="verse0">When day came in, <em>beek’d</em> by the sun,</p>
<p class="verse0">They lay and slept till afternoon:</p>
<p class="verse0">Then took their travels that very night,</p>
<p class="verse0">To Achnacarie came full right,</p>
<p class="verse0">Through water to their <em>cleavings</em> high,</p>
<p class="verse0">Dark was the night, they could not see.</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon the morrow they kill’d a cow,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whereof they fill’d their bellies fu’,</p>
<p class="verse0">Without bread, salt or sallad,</p>
<p class="verse0">Sweet hunger relished their palate;</p>
<p class="verse0">They told the flesh, bread was before,</p>
<p class="verse0">And thankful were they had such store,</p>
<p class="verse0">The country being burnt, and plunder’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">And here to live no way they had.</p>
<p class="verse0">On the next day Lochgarie came,</p>
<p class="verse0">And with him doctor Cameron,</p>
<p class="verse0">On their return back from Lochiel,</p>
<p class="verse0">They bade the Prince for safety still,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">To cross the hills near Badenoch;</p>
<p class="verse0">For Athole <em>braes</em> were safe enough,</p>
<p class="verse0">Among good friends could <em>skulk</em> a while,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till time was found to leave this isle,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whereat the Prince was well content,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to their journey then they went,</p>
<p class="verse0">Travell’d by night and slept by day,</p>
<p class="verse0">Through many a <em>glen</em> and <em>awkward</em> way.</p>
<p class="verse0">Lochiel and he again did meet,</p>
<p class="verse0">And loud they cry’d like infants sweet,</p>
<p class="verse0">Contrived now what should be done,</p>
<p class="verse0">Once more all hazards for to run.</p>
<p class="verse0">His brother the priest, of modest mouth,</p>
<p class="verse0">To hire a vessel they sent south,</p>
<p class="verse0">To take them off from the north shore;</p>
<p class="verse0">Because that coast was watch’d no more.</p>
<p class="verse0">But ere that he could get that done,</p>
<p class="verse0">They found another of safer run,</p>
<p class="verse0">On north and west they watches set,</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon the French ships for to wait,</p>
<p class="verse0">Still thinking that the Dunkirk sloop,</p>
<p class="verse0">Might yet be hov’ring round about,</p>
<p class="verse0">From which the Frenchmen did come,</p>
<p class="verse0">And still attempt, to take them home:</p>
<p class="verse0">Their signals to many ships they us’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">But ne’er a one to answer chus’d.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Now col’nel Warren had got to France,</p>
<p class="verse0">And brought a privateer from Nantz,</p>
<p class="verse0">With three hundred and forty men,</p>
<p class="verse0">Well arm’d, with thirty guns and ten</p>
<p class="verse0">Of carr’ge and swivels which she bore,</p>
<p class="verse0">The best sailer he could procure,</p>
<p class="verse0">The Bellona, of St. Maloes by name,</p>
<p class="verse0">To anchor in Loch Moidart came,</p>
<p class="verse0">And here the col’nel came on shore,</p>
<p class="verse0">To a house where he had been before,</p>
<p class="verse0">About the Prince for to enquire,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">By chance the watch was waiting there,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who knew what rout the Prince was gone,</p>
<p class="verse0">And made it to the col’nel known,</p>
<p class="verse0">Besides these officers of note,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who now were lurking in a hut.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then to the Prince express he sent,</p>
<p class="verse0">Now was the time for his intent,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who did set out that very night,</p>
<p class="verse0">And message sent to all he might,</p>
<p class="verse0">With speed at Moidart to appear,</p>
<p class="verse0">With Warren, on board of privateer,</p>
<p class="verse0">The two officers likewise came,</p>
<p class="verse0">And met the Prince, who dash’d their frame,</p>
<p class="verse0">Because with him they’d been so free,</p>
<p class="verse0">When they took him Drummond to be.</p>
<p class="verse0">But nevertheless he smil’d it over,</p>
<p class="verse0">Hoping from suff’rings they’d all recover.</p>
<p class="verse0">All who came, did haste on board,</p>
<p class="verse0">Last went himself, then sheath’d his sword,</p>
<p class="verse0">Regretted sore, he was so kind,</p>
<p class="verse0">So many suff’rers left behind.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Thus on September the twenti’th day,</p>
<p class="verse0">He from Loch-Moidart sail’d away,</p>
<p class="verse0">The wind was low, the waves were kind,</p>
<p class="verse0">To clear the land they much inclin’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">No tempests rag’d as in times before,</p>
<p class="verse0">As now the blast of Fate was o’er,</p>
<p class="verse0">No foes on sea did them perplex,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till safe at Roscort, near Morlaix,</p>
<p class="verse0">They on the twenty-ninth did land,</p>
<p class="verse0">Poor Charlie and his broken band,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Who all had surely been bewitch’d</p>
<p class="verse0">By Spaniards and the subtile French,</p>
<p class="verse0">They then to Paris did proceed,</p>
<p class="verse0">To be refitted, great was their need.</p>
<p class="verse0">He went <em>incog.</em> into Versailles,</p>
<p class="verse0">With no attendance at his heels,</p>
<p class="verse0">Receiv’d by King and Queen of France,</p>
<p class="verse0">To them he told his mournful chance,</p>
<p class="verse0">His sufferings they’re surpris’d to hear,</p>
<p class="verse0">And a thousand welcomes did appear.</p>
<p class="verse0">So for his honour, I understand,</p>
<p class="verse0">A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Feu de joy</i> they did command,</p>
<p class="verse0">That he should in procession come,</p>
<p class="verse0">With sound of trumpet, beat of drum.</p>
<p class="verse0">In the first coach there was conducted,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lord Og’lvie, Elcho, and Glen-Bucket;</p>
<p class="verse0">And with the Prince, there next came on</p>
<p class="verse0">Lochiel, and lord Lewis Gordon,</p>
<p class="verse0">Pages around, with ten footmen,</p>
<p class="verse0">The Prince of Wales’ liv’ry on them,</p>
<p class="verse0">Kept by the Prince on ev’ry side,</p>
<p class="verse0">While thousands did admire their pride.&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">Here Kelly who broke London tower,</p>
<p class="verse0">And Stafford, late from Newgate bower,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who both from prison stole away,</p>
<p class="verse0">And in Britain could no longer stay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Young Lochiel brought up the rear,</p>
<p class="verse0">With three gentlemen of the bed chamber.</p>
<p class="verse0">These did all on horseback prance,</p>
<p class="verse0">In procession to the court of France.</p>
<p class="verse0">That night the Prince supt with the King,</p>
<p class="verse0">In Loch-aber the like he had not seen,</p>
<p class="verse0">Nor yet in Uist, fainting for fault,</p>
<p class="verse0">When glad of <em>brochan</em> wanting salt.</p>
<p class="verse0">He hir’d a fine house, <em>The Theatine</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which stands upon the banks of Seine,</p>
<p class="verse0">A river does through Paris run,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Ev’n as the Thames does through London.</p>
<p class="verse0">His nobles all commissions got,</p>
<p class="verse0">And form’d new reg’ments, Did they not,</p>
<p class="verse0">The Scots, English, and Irish too,</p>
<p class="verse0">Fought well at Vall, and stood full true?</p>
<p class="verse0">The British troops they did not spare,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which was not altogether fair,</p>
<p class="verse0">Commanded by Og’lvie and Lochiel;</p>
<p class="verse0">But Charles took no command himsel.</p>
<p class="verse0"><em>Incog.</em> he once to Madrid went;</p>
<p class="verse0">But soon return’d, right ill content:</p>
<p class="verse0">For about this time his brother <em>gat</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">From Rome’s Bishop a Card’nal’s hat,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which does not any honour bring,</p>
<p class="verse0">To Princes of Protestant spring,</p>
<p class="verse0">In connexion with such a See</p>
<p class="verse0">No Protestant can ever be.</p>
<p class="verse0">At this great Charles was much chagrin’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Would hear no more of him as friend,</p>
<p class="verse0">Omitted ev’n to drink his health,</p>

<p class="verse2">While he at Paris did reside,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were silver and copper medals made,</p>
<p class="verse0">With an inscription thus exprest,</p>

<p class="verse0">This in letters round the head,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Trial and Execution of severals at Kensington, Brampton, and
Carlisle.&mdash;&mdash;The Lords Kilmarnock, Cromartie, Balmerino,
Lovat, and Charles Ratcliff.</em></p>


<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Poor Scotland yet did sigh and moan,</p>
<p class="verse0">Because her suff’rings were not gone,</p>
<p class="verse0">A time of trial for her deeds,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where many lost their hearts and heads.</p>
<p class="verse0">The mildest was Kensington muir,</p>
<p class="verse0">Not far from London to be sure,</p>
<p class="verse0">Seventeen officers by the neck</p>
<p class="verse0">Were hung like dogs, without respect:</p>
<p class="verse0">No clergy benefit, or Psalms at a’,</p>
<p class="verse0">Cheer’d by the mob with loud huzza:</p>
<p class="verse0">Elev’n at York, shar’d the same fate:</p>
<p class="verse0">Seven at Penrith, thus too were treat:</p>
<p class="verse0">Six at Brampton likewise fell:</p>
<p class="verse0">And nine were butcher’d at Carlisle:</p>
<p class="verse0">Many were sent to the Plantations,</p>
<p class="verse0">To live among the savage nations,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which indeed was a milder act,</p>
<p class="verse0">Than what is in the following tract,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of these poor souls at Carlisle,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Whose execution was so vile,</p>
<p class="verse0">A wooden stage they did erect,</p>
<p class="verse0">And first, half strangl’d by the neck,</p>
<p class="verse0">A fire upon the stage was born,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their hearts out of their breasts were torn,</p>
<p class="verse0">The privy part unspared was,</p>
<p class="verse0">Cut off, and dash’d into their face,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then expanded into the fire;</p>
<p class="verse0">But such a sight I’ll ne’er desire,</p>
<p class="verse0">Some beholders swooned away,</p>
<p class="verse0">Others stood mute, had nought to say,</p>
<p class="verse0">And some of a more brutish nature,</p>
<p class="verse0">Did shout <em>Huzza</em>, to seal the matter,</p>
<p class="verse0">Some a mourning turn’d about</p>
<p class="verse0">A praying for their souls, no doubt,</p>
<p class="verse0">Some curs’d the butcher, Haxam Willie,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who without remorse used his <em>gullie</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">And for the same a pension got,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thus butchering the <em>Rebel Scot</em>.</p>
<p class="verse0">God keep all foes, and friends of mine,</p>
<p class="verse0">From death of such a cruel kind:</p>
<p class="verse0">It did fulfil an English law;</p>
<p class="verse0">But such a sight I never saw.</p>
<p class="verse0">O! may it ever a warning be,</p>
<p class="verse0">From rebellious mobs, to keep us free!</p>
<p class="verse0">My dear Scots-men, a warning take,</p>
<p class="verse0">Superior pow’rs not to forsake,</p>
<p class="verse0">Mind the Apostle’s words, of law and love,</p>
<p class="verse0">Saying, <em>All power is giv’n from above</em>.</p>
<p class="verse0">’Tis by will of heav’n kings do reign,</p>
<p class="verse0">The chain of Fate’s not rul’d by men.</p>
<p class="verse0">Every thing must serve its time,</p>
<p class="verse0">And so have kings of Stewart’s line.</p>
<p class="verse0">Methinks they’re fools, whate’er they be,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who draw their sword to stick the sea,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or call upon the wind to <em>bide</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">Think not that strength will turn the tide;</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Though praying made the sun to stand,</p>
<p class="verse0">When help’d by an Almighty hand:</p>
<p class="verse0">All those who fight without offence,</p>
<p class="verse0">Get but a dreadful recompence:</p>
<p class="verse0">And those who trust in France or Spain,</p>
<p class="verse0">Are fools if e’er they do’t again:</p>
<p class="verse0">Witness poor Charlie and the Scots,</p>
<p class="verse0">What have they got, but bloody throats?</p>
<p class="verse0">Charlie’s from France banish’d, like a thief,</p>
<p class="verse0">A poor reward for his toil and grief.</p>
<p class="verse0">Poor simple Charles they have thee tricked,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thy wage is almost like the wicked.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Now the trials were brought on,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of the Chiefs who had with Charlie gone,</p>
<p class="verse0">My lord Kilmarnock and Cromartie,</p>
<p class="verse0">In Westminster-Hall judged to be,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lord Lovat and Balmerino,</p>
<p class="verse0">One Mr. Ratcliff indicted also</p>
<p class="verse0">Before their peers, for high treason,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were to the bar brought, one by one,</p>
<p class="verse0">Lord Kilmarnock did first appear,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who humbly own’d his guilt was clear,</p>
<p class="verse0">Confess’d his folly, and heinousness,</p>
<p class="verse0">How obnoxious to punishment he was.</p>
<p class="verse0">For offences of so deep a dye,</p>
<p class="verse0">Begg’d they’d interceed with’s Majesty,</p>
<p class="verse0">That the unshaken fidelitie</p>
<p class="verse0">Of’s ancestors should remembred be,</p>
<p class="verse0">His father having been a steady one,</p>
<p class="verse0">In promoting the Revolution,</p>
<p class="verse0">Took active measures to secure</p>
<p class="verse0">The protestant succession to endure,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which keeps the kingdoms quiet and firm,</p>
<p class="verse0">From arbitrary and Popish harm:</p>
<p class="verse0">This was well known for certain truth.</p>
<p class="verse0">His own ev’ry action from his youth,</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon the strictest enquiry</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Was a course of firmest loyalty,</p>
<p class="verse0">Until that very unhappy time,</p>
<p class="verse0">He was seduc’d with them to join,</p>
<p class="verse0">Soon after the battle of Preston,</p>
<p class="verse0">He by flatt’ry was prevail’d upon:</p>
<p class="verse0">That he bought no arms, listed no men,</p>
<p class="verse0">Persuaded none to join that train:</p>
<p class="verse0">He endeavour’d their rage to moderate,</p>
<p class="verse0">For sick and wounded med’cines <em>gat</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">And for prisoners begg’d lenity,</p>
<p class="verse0">This many a soldier could testify.</p>
<p class="verse0">That for his error he had feel’d smart,</p>
<p class="verse0">With pining grief and aching heart;</p>
<p class="verse0">Ev’n at Culloden, chus’d not to fly,</p>
<p class="verse0">But rather among the slain to ly:</p>
<p class="verse0">He wish’d Providence had aim’d a shot,</p>
<p class="verse0">That there to fall might been his lot,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ere he’d flee to foreign power for aid:</p>
<p class="verse0">No, that he never wou’d, he said:</p>
<p class="verse0">If he did so, conscience would tell,</p>
<p class="verse0">’Twas continuing in Rebellion still:</p>
<p class="verse0">He had seen a letter from the French court,</p>
<p class="verse0">The British Sovereign to exhort,</p>
<p class="verse0">In what a manner he should deal</p>
<p class="verse0">With such subjects as did rebel.</p>
<p class="verse0">But he abhorr’d the mediation</p>
<p class="verse0">Of any foreign intercession;</p>
<p class="verse0">’Pon his Majesty’s great clemency,</p>
<p class="verse0">For sacred mercy I rely,</p>
<p class="verse0">And if no favour’s to me shown,</p>
<p class="verse0">With resignation, I’ll lay down,</p>
<p class="verse0">My head upon the fatal block,</p>
<p class="verse0">For to receive the dreadful stroke,</p>
<p class="verse0">With my very last breath fervently pray,</p>
<p class="verse0">That th’ illustr’ous house of Hanover may,</p>
<p class="verse0">In peace and prosperity ever shine,</p>
<p class="verse0">And Britain rule, to th’ end of time.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">The earl of Cromartie came next,</p>
<p class="verse0">While all their eyes were on him fixt,</p>
<p class="verse0">He begg’d their lordships for to hear,</p>
<p class="verse0">How ungrateful guilt brought him there,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which justly merited indignation,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of his Majesty, and all the nation.</p>
<p class="verse0">The treasonable offence, said he,</p>
<p class="verse0">He’d ne’er attempt to justifie,</p>
<p class="verse0">His plea did on their compassion ly,</p>
<p class="verse0">And his Majesty’s royal clemency:</p>
<p class="verse0">Appeal’d to his conduct in time bygone,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ere that unhappy Rebellion.</p>
<p class="verse0">Witness the commander at Inverness,</p>
<p class="verse0">And the lord President Forbes,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who knew his acts and loyal ways,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till seduc’d by designing phrase:</p>
<p class="verse0">His awful remorse, made him to fret</p>
<p class="verse0">Severely now, Alas! too late,</p>
<p class="verse0">Life and fortune valu’d not at all,</p>
<p class="verse0">But his loving wife, now drown’d in gall,</p>
<p class="verse0">With a babe unborn, of children eight,</p>
<p class="verse0">All brought to a most mournful plight,</p>
<p class="verse0">His eldest son with these must drie</p>
<p class="verse0">The penalties of his miserie,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Let these Objects of mercy be</p>
<p class="verse0">“Known to his most gracious Majestie,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Let innocent children now produce</p>
<p class="verse0">“Bowels of pity in this house,</p>
<p class="verse0">“As men of honour be men of feeling,</p>
<p class="verse0">“My griefs to you needs no revealing.”</p>
<p class="verse0">He pled his blood might quench his crime,</p>
<p class="verse0">That their inn’cence should be kept in mind,</p>
<p class="verse0">That those to mis’ry should not be brought,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who of his guilt had never thought:</p>
<p class="verse0">Since public justice would not let pass</p>
<p class="verse0">From him that cup of bitterness,</p>
<p class="verse0">Desir’d their Lordships to go on,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">And said, <em>The will of God be done</em>.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Then Balmerino next came on,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who, as friend or foe, regarded none;</p>
<p class="verse0">But star’d about, and look’d as bold,</p>
<p class="verse0">As he had been judge, that court to hold,</p>
<p class="verse0">And ’gainst them mov’d a point of law,</p>
<p class="verse0"><em>His indictment was not worth a straw,</em></p>
<p class="verse0"><em>As being in the county of Surry founded,</em></p>
<p class="verse0"><em>For acts of treason in Scotland grounded:</em></p>
<p class="verse0"><em>Therefore should be in Scotland try’d</em>;</p>
<p class="verse0">But this the House of Lords deny’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">And said, <em>The British Parliament</em></p>
<p class="verse0"><em>Rul’d over all the king’s extent</em>:</p>
<p class="verse0">Therefore he’s forc’d to wave his plea;</p>
<p class="verse0">But not a fig regarded he,</p>
<p class="verse0">As mercy he scorn’d for to crave.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then all three sentence did receive,</p>
<p class="verse0">“To be beheaded on Tower-hill,</p>
<p class="verse0">(A humble bow they gave there-till,)</p>
<p class="verse0">“On the eighteenth August, Forty-Six,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Their heads be sever’d by an ax,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Quite from their bodies, on open stage,</p>
<p class="verse0">“To lose both life and heritage,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Their estates forfeit to the crown.”</p>
<p class="verse0">Which makes the babes unborn frown</p>
<p class="verse0">And parents folly to lament.</p>
<p class="verse0">So to the Tow’r they all were sent,</p>
<p class="verse0">For to prepare for their exit,</p>
<p class="verse0">And with a greater Judge to meet.</p>
<p class="verse0">Kilmarnock was as a Christian mov’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">The time though short he well improv’d.</p>
<p class="verse0">Balmerino took little thought,</p>
<p class="verse0">As by the Sacrament all was bought,</p>
<p class="verse0">And the externals of the book,</p>
<p class="verse0">His persuasion did no farther look.</p>
<p class="verse0">When the Dead-warrant was to him sent,</p>
<p class="verse0">To Cromartie they did present</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">A remit for life and libertie;</p>
<p class="verse0">But the other two Lords were to die.</p>
<p class="verse0">While Balmerino at dinner sat,</p>
<p class="verse0">The tidings came, how, and what</p>
<p class="verse0">Was to be done on the next day,</p>
<p class="verse0">His lady rose and swoon’d away;</p>
<p class="verse0">He rose from’s chair, says, You’re distracted,</p>
<p class="verse0">It is no more than I expected,</p>
<p class="verse0">Sit down, my lady, and did constrain her,</p>
<p class="verse0">It shall not make me lose my dinner,</p>
<p class="verse0">I know we all were born to die,</p>
<p class="verse0">From death at last, where can we flee?</p>
<p class="verse0">By his mild words she kept her seat;</p>
<p class="verse0">But ne’er a bit at all could eat.</p>
<p class="verse0">He took the Sacrament, they say,</p>
<p class="verse0">After th’ Episcopalian way,</p>
<p class="verse0">With a Roman courage and resolution,</p>
<p class="verse0">Boldly waited his dissolution,</p>
<p class="verse0">And of his fate oft made a jest,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which to English eyes wou’d be a feast.</p>
<p class="verse0">He often walked without his coat</p>
<p class="verse0">With shirt open about his throat,</p>
<p class="verse0">One of his friends unto him told,</p>
<p class="verse0">He’d wrong his health by getting cold,</p>
<p class="verse0">To which he answered again,</p>
<p class="verse0">The lease of it was near an end,</p>
<p class="verse0">’Twas the height of folly to repair,</p>
<p class="verse0">For all the time it had to wear.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">On the next day, the stage being erect,</p>
<p class="verse0">All rail’d about and hung with black,</p>
<p class="verse0">A thousand foot-guards march’d theretil,</p>
<p class="verse0">And form’d betwixt the Tow’r and hill.</p>
<p class="verse0">The stage within the line enclos’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">A full free passage so compos’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">The horse Grenadiers posted without,</p>
<p class="verse0">As to <em>awe</em> the crowd they were more stout,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thus was it fixt right near until</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">The Transport-office at Tow’r-hill,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which, that day, was hir’d for reception,</p>
<p class="verse0">Until they went to execution.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">About the hour of ten o’clock,</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon the stage they fixt the block,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which cover’d also was with black,</p>
<p class="verse0">And of saw dust had several sack,</p>
<p class="verse0">For to sprinkle upon the blood,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being judged for that purpose good:</p>
<p class="verse0">Their covered coffins within the rails,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ornamented with gilded nails,</p>
<p class="verse0">And plates, with their inscription,</p>
<p class="verse0">Were fixed upon ev’ry one&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">’Twas thus upon Kilmarnock’s plate,</p>
<p class="verse0">In Capital Letters engraved,</p>
<p class="verse2"><span class="smcap">Gulielmus Comes de Kilmarnock</span>,</p>
<p class="verse4"><span class="smcap">Decollatus</span> 18<em>mo.</em> <span class="smcap">Augusti,</span></p>

<p class="verse6"><span class="smcap">Aetat. Suae, XLII.</span></p>
<p class="verse0">His Coronet was thereto added,</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon the plates likewise engraved,</p>
<p class="verse0">And Balmerino’s inscription,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was deeply grav’d the plate upon.</p>
<p class="verse2"><span class="smcap">Arthurus Dominus de Balmerino</span>,</p>
<p class="verse4"><span class="smcap">Decollatus</span> 18<em>mo.</em> <span class="smcap">Augusti,</span></p>

<p class="verse0">Thus plac’d in a conspicuous light,</p>
<p class="verse0">With a Baron’s coronet shining bright.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Then after ten, near half an hour,</p>
<p class="verse0">The two Sheriffs went to the Tow’r,</p>
<p class="verse0">Knock’d at the gate, the Porter cry’d,</p>
<p class="verse0"><em>What do you want?</em> They then reply’d,</p>
<p class="verse0"><em>The bodies of these Lords two,</em></p>
<p class="verse0"><em>Kilmarnock and Balmerino.</em></p>
<p class="verse0">The Lieutenants and his Wardens brought</p>
<p class="verse0">These two Lords for whom they sought,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">And got receipts for each of them,</p>
<p class="verse0">As usual is to give the same.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">And as they past out from the Tower,</p>
<p class="verse0">(’Tis usually said as they leave the door,)</p>
<p class="verse0">God bless King George, the Warder cry’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">God bless K&mdash;&mdash;g J&mdash;&mdash;s, Balmerino reply’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">But Kilmarnock made a humble bow,</p>
<p class="verse0">For Balmerino, seem’d nought to rue,</p>
<p class="verse0">His regimentals and all was on,</p>
<p class="verse0">The same as he had at Culloden.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Now, this procession slowly steers,</p>
<p class="verse0">Under a guard of musqueteers,</p>
<p class="verse0">The Sheriffs and their officers,</p>
<p class="verse0">Tow’r-hamlets and tip-staves in pairs,</p>
<p class="verse0">Two hearses and a mourning coach,</p>
<p class="verse0">All to the scaffold did approach,</p>
<p class="verse0">Three clergymen were there also,</p>
<p class="verse0">The one with Balmerino</p>
<p class="verse0">Was of the Episcopalian strain,</p>
<p class="verse0">Th’ others were Presbyterian men,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who had of late from Scotland come,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their names were Forester and Hume,</p>
<p class="verse0">They did upon Kilmarnock wait,</p>
<p class="verse0">Assisting in his last exit.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Unto the tavern first they went,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where some time in devotion spent,</p>
<p class="verse0">And taking of their friends farewel</p>
<p class="verse0">Tears did anguish and grief reveal:</p>
<p class="verse0">As to the tavern they did go,</p>
<p class="verse0">Some ask’d, Which is Balmerino?</p>
<p class="verse0">He turn’d about and <em>smiling says</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">I’m Balmerino, if you please.</p>
<p class="verse0">In the inn they’re put in sep’rate rooms,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where mourning was, and heavy moans.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then Balmerino he did require</p>
<p class="verse0">A conference with Kilmarnock there.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then said, “My Lord, before we go,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">“One thing of you I want to know,</p>
<p class="verse0">“That of it the world we may convince;</p>
<p class="verse0">“Heard you of orders from our Prince,</p>
<p class="verse0">“If we had Culloden battle won,</p>
<p class="verse0">“That quarters should be giv’n to none?”</p>
<p class="verse0">To which Kilmarnock answer’d, NO;</p>
<p class="verse0">NOR I, Sir; cry’d Balmerino,</p>
<p class="verse0">“It seems this on invention borders,</p>
<p class="verse0">“To justify this way of murders.”</p>
<p class="verse0">“No, said the Earl, “by inference just,</p>
<p class="verse0">“To tell the truth, for so we must,</p>
<p class="verse0">“While prisoners at Inverness,</p>
<p class="verse0">“I heard some officers express,</p>

<p class="verse0">“More of the matter I do not know.”</p>
<p class="verse0">“If Murray (said he) did the same,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Why did they give the Prince the blame?”</p>
<p class="verse0">And then a final farewel took,</p>
<p class="verse0">And parted with a mournful look,</p>
<p class="verse0">“I’m sorry (he cry’d) as he was gone,</p>
<p class="verse0">“That I cannot pay this score alone,”</p>
<p class="verse0">Then turning round upon his heel,</p>
<p class="verse0">For time, my friend, For ay farewel.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Kilmarnock some time in pray’r spent,</p>
<p class="verse0">While tears did flow from all present,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then took a glass to cool his heart,</p>
<p class="verse0">Before he did the room depart.</p>
<p class="verse0">The warrand him mention’d first to go,</p>
<p class="verse0">And being inform’d it must be so,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then to the stage he did approach,</p>
<p class="verse0">Seeing the hearse, coffins, mourning coach,</p>
<p class="verse0">The dreadful block, edg’d instrument,</p>
<p class="verse0">With the executioner and crowd’s lament,</p>
<p class="verse0">He paus’d a while, and thus said he,</p>
<p class="verse0"><em>O Hume, ’tis terrible this to me!</em></p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">His pale countenance, contrite demure,</p>
<p class="verse0">Did pity from all around procure,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being tall and graceful, cloth’d in black,</p>
<p class="verse0">In a praying posture, mildly spake,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which did the multitude surprize,</p>
<p class="verse0">While brinish tears showr’d from their eyes,</p>
<p class="verse0">And many said, <em>He’s dying well,</em></p>
<p class="verse0"><em>Howe’er he liv’d we cannot tell</em>.</p>
<p class="verse0">The head cutter first took a glass,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then came to ask him forgiv’ness;</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet drink did not quite drown his fears,</p>
<p class="verse0">At the awful scene he burst in tears:</p>
<p class="verse0">But the Earl bade him not be afraid,</p>
<p class="verse0">As it must be done by some, he said,</p>
<p class="verse0">Gave him five guineas in a purse,</p>
<p class="verse0">And bade him strike without remorse,</p>
<p class="verse0">When I let my handkerchief fall,</p>
<p class="verse0">Do you proceed by that signal.</p>
<p class="verse0">With eyes and hands lift up in pray’r,</p>
<p class="verse0">Most earnestly he did require,</p>
<p class="verse0">The pray’rs of’s greatest enemie,</p>
<p class="verse0">And all the crowd around that be,</p>
<p class="verse0">In the fatal moment of <em>exit</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">That <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> might receive his sp’rit,</p>
<p class="verse0">Pray’d for King George most fervently,</p>
<p class="verse0">And bless’d his royal Family.</p>
<p class="verse0">As he promis’d to do at his end,</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon that day he was condemn’d.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Then for the block he did prepare,</p>
<p class="verse0">His gentleman ty’d up his hair,</p>
<p class="verse0">Took off the bag and the big coat,</p>
<p class="verse0">His neck made bare all ’round the throat,</p>
<p class="verse0">On a black cushion he kneel’d down,</p>
<p class="verse0">While friends stood weeping all around:</p>
<p class="verse0">The mournings off the rails they threw,</p>
<p class="verse0">That all around might have a view,</p>
<p class="verse0">His neck right on the block it lay,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">With hands stretcht out to swim away,</p>
<p class="verse0">And when he let the handkerchief go,</p>
<p class="verse0">He did receive the fatal blow,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which cut the head off to a tack</p>
<p class="verse0">Of skin, cut by a second hack.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Thus did a brave Lord end his days,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whose head was kept upon red baize,</p>
<p class="verse0">And with his body in coffin laid,</p>
<p class="verse0">By Forester with his servants aid,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which quickly to the hearse they bore,</p>
<p class="verse0">And clear’d the block and stage of gore,</p>
<p class="verse0">By sprinkling fresh saw-dust thereon,</p>
<p class="verse0">That sign of slaughter there was none.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Then Balmerino he came forth,</p>
<p class="verse0">Like a bold hero from the North,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who of death itself was not afraid,</p>
<p class="verse0">At least, he show’d but small regard,</p>
<p class="verse0">Cloth’d in his regimental <em>Blue</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">Trimmed with gold, a warlike hue.</p>
<p class="verse0">He pray’d to God, and mercy sought;</p>
<p class="verse0">But fear of men was past his thought:</p>
<p class="verse0">Drank to’s friends ere he left the room,</p>
<p class="verse0">And charg’d them all for to drink round,</p>
<p class="verse0"><em>Ain degree to heaven for me</em></p>
<p class="verse0">And wish’d them better times to see:</p>
<p class="verse0">Then said, <em>Gentlemen a long adieu,</em></p>
<p class="verse0"><em>I’m detaining both myself and you</em>.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then to the scaffold he went full brief,</p>
<p class="verse0">No signs of sorrow, fear or grief,</p>
<p class="verse0">And round it walk’d a turn or two,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where he saw acquaintance, gave a bow:</p>
<p class="verse0">The inscription on his coffin read,</p>
<p class="verse0">Said, <em>That is right</em>, and shook his head.</p>
<p class="verse0">The block he call’d, His pillow of rest,</p>
<p class="verse0">And said, That ax has been well drest,</p>
<p class="verse0">The executioner’s shoulder did clap,</p>
<p class="verse0">And said, My friend, give a free chap,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">You ask my pardon, but that’s a fable,</p>
<p class="verse0">Your business is commendable:</p>
<p class="verse0">Here’s but three guineas, it is not much;</p>
<p class="verse0">For in my life I ne’er was rich,</p>
<p class="verse0">I’m sorry I can add no more to it,</p>
<p class="verse0">But my coat and vest, I will allow it,</p>
<p class="verse0">The buttons, indeed, they are but brass;</p>
<p class="verse0">But do thy bus’ness ne’ertheless,</p>
<p class="verse0">Stript off his coat and neck-cloth too,</p>
<p class="verse0">And them upon his coffin threw:</p>
<p class="verse0">A flannel waist-coat then put on,</p>
<p class="verse0">With a tartan cap his head upon,</p>
<p class="verse0">Then said, For honour of the Clan,</p>
<p class="verse0">This day I die as a Scots-man.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then adjusted his posture on the block,</p>
<p class="verse0">Shewing his signal for the stroke,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was by dropping of his arms down:</p>
<p class="verse0">Then turning to his friends aroun’,</p>
<p class="verse0">He once more of them took farewel,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to the crowd around did wheel,</p>
<p class="verse0">Perhaps you’ll think that I’m too bold,</p>
<p class="verse0">This to a gentleman he told,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whom he perceived standing near,</p>
<p class="verse0">But, Sir, I solemnly declare,</p>
<p class="verse0">’Tis all through confidence in God,</p>
<p class="verse0">A sound conscience, and cause avow’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">If I dissemble with signs of fear,</p>
<p class="verse0">I were unworthy of dying here.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then to the executioner said,</p>
<p class="verse0">Strike resolute and have no dread:</p>
<p class="verse0">For I’ll surely count you for a foe,</p>
<p class="verse0">Unless you give a hearty blow,</p>
<p class="verse0">To the stage side did then retire,</p>
<p class="verse0">And call’d the Warder to come nigh’r,</p>
<p class="verse0">Asking which was the hearse for him,</p>
<p class="verse0">Bade the driver come nearer in,</p>
<p class="verse0">Immediately kneel’d to the block,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Stretch’d out his arms, and thus he spoke,</p>
<p class="verse0">“O Lord reward my friends, he cries,</p>
<p class="verse0">“And now forgive mine enemies,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Receive my soul, good Lord, I crave,”</p>
<p class="verse0">So his arms fell, the signal gave.</p>
<p class="verse0">At this unlook’d for suddenness,</p>
<p class="verse0">Th’ executioner surpriz’d was,</p>
<p class="verse0">Did unprepar’d direct the blow,</p>
<p class="verse0">That deep enough it did not go,</p>
<p class="verse0">Before the second he turn’d his head,</p>
<p class="verse0">As if in anger his jaws they <em>gade</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">Gnashing his teeth so veh’mently,</p>
<p class="verse0">The head went off by blows three.</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon red baize, the chopt-off head,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was in coffin with his body laid.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then the two hearses drove away,</p>
<p class="verse0">To the grave where Tullibardine lay,</p>
<p class="verse0">In St. Peter’s Church, into the Tower,</p>

<p class="verse0">For to get safe away to France:</p>
<p class="verse0">And he with King James went to Rome,</p>
<p class="verse0">And zealous Papist did become.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Twice return’d to England again,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thinking his pardon to obtain;</p>
<p class="verse0">But when he found it would not do,</p>
<p class="verse0">A French commission he clapt into,</p>
<p class="verse0">And there remain’d till Forty-Six,</p>
<p class="verse0">When he thought, as heir, to refix</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon the lands of Derwentwater;</p>
<p class="verse0">But yet he did not mend the matter:</p>
<p class="verse0">For as he did for Scotland steer,</p>
<p class="verse0">On board of a French privateer,</p>
<p class="verse0">The Sheerness catched him at sea,</p>
<p class="verse0">With Scots and Irish more than he,</p>
<p class="verse0">Bold officers for the Pretender,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who yet were forced to surrender.</p>
<p class="verse0">His Sire was Sir Francis of Derwentwater,</p>
<p class="verse0">By extract from a Royal fornicator:</p>
<p class="verse0">His mother’s name was Mary Tudor,</p>
<p class="verse0">From Charles the second, a nat’ral brooder,</p>
<p class="verse0">Her mother’s name was Mary Davis,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whom the King lov’d as any <em>mavis</em>:</p>
<p class="verse0">By this he came of Stewarts’ line,</p>
<p class="verse0">And blood to blood doth much incline;</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet, b’ equivocation to get free,</p>
<p class="verse0">Deny’d himself Ratcliff to be,</p>

<p class="verse0">Though three and thirty years between.</p>
<p class="verse0">Upon December the eighth day,</p>
<p class="verse0">He to Tow’r-hill was led away</p>
<p class="verse0">Where stage and block they did up-fix,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">And cut his head off at three licks,</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet of his death he was right vain,</p>

<p class="verse0">His coffin was made super-fine,</p>
<p class="verse0">Its handles all like gold did shine.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">In Roman faith he liv’d and pray’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">And in that sort of faith he dy’d:</p>
<p class="verse0">All seeming repentance he declin’d</p>
<p class="verse0">As in Purgatory to be refin’d:</p>
<p class="verse0">And had salvation so a cooking,</p>
<p class="verse0">As to think no more of death than ducking,</p>
<p class="verse0">Being so stout a Pope’s believer,</p>
<p class="verse0">Went to death as he would swim a river;</p>
<p class="verse0">The priest’ clear’d all the passes for him,</p>

<p class="verse0">He smil’d his coffin to look upon,</p>

<p class="verse0">Most of th’ impeachments he deny’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Half dead with age, and almost deaf,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which did them plague, and caus’d mischief:</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">For when they cry’d and cry’d again,</p>
<p class="verse0">He answer’d on some other strain,</p>
<p class="verse0">And told them, it was no fair trade,</p>
<p class="verse0">As he did not hear one word they said,</p>
<p class="verse0">And did not see what they could do,</p>
<p class="verse0">As he ’gainst George his sword ne’er drew;</p>
<p class="verse0">But always was governments’ friend:</p>
<p class="verse0">Therefore he wonder’d what they mean’d.</p>
<p class="verse0">In the year <em>Fifteen</em> it was well known,</p>
<p class="verse0">How much his loyalty was shown,</p>
<p class="verse0">In quenching that rebellious storm,</p>
<p class="verse0">What brave exploits he did perform.</p>

<p class="verse2">Yet his servants were witness led</p>
<p class="verse0">Of every deed done and said,</p>
<p class="verse0">In supporting the rebellious way,</p>
<p class="verse0">And so their proof bore heavy sway,</p>
<p class="verse0">What Charles drank that afternoon,</p>
<p class="verse0">When from Culloden he did run.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then for his life was no remead,</p>
<p class="verse0">He was condemn’d to lose his head,</p>

<p class="verse0"><em>’Tis sweet and glorious a patriot to die</em>.</p>

<p class="verse0">Which he to Lord President sent,</p>
<p class="verse0">When he advis’d him to repent,</p>

<p class="verse0">And ask’d from whence such law could come,</p>
<p class="verse0">As punish a father for the son?</p>
<p class="verse0">If’s son and the young clan were lost,</p>

<p class="verse0">That if his person were attack’d</p>
<p class="verse0">His foes should be in collops hack’d,</p>

<p class="verse0">As it was not far unto his tomb.</p>
<p class="verse0">When dead, his countrywives he’d have</p>
<p class="verse0"><em>Cronoch</em> to sing around his grave.</p>

<p class="verse0">Us’d him to carry when a boy,</p>
<p class="verse0">Through Kingston park and Hampton Court</p>
<p class="verse0">And to his Royal Sire made sport.</p>

<p class="verse2">A zealous Roman did to him write,</p>

<p class="verse0">That he wanted a service of plate,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">At twenty thousand crowns in rate,</p>
<p class="verse0">Charg’d to be ready ’gainst such a day,</p>
<p class="verse0">Without excuses or delay.</p>
<p class="verse0">Before this work was well begun,</p>
<p class="verse0">Another the King must have as soon,</p>
<p class="verse0">This put the jeweller in dread,</p>
<p class="verse0">Straight to the Prince he did proceed,</p>
<p class="verse0">Told him the matter, begg’d more time,</p>
<p class="verse0">No, said he, the first order’s mine,</p>
<p class="verse0">Go to the King and let him know&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">Then said Lewis, <em>Let it be so</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thinking that he was going away,</p>
<p class="verse0">But yet this caus’d some more delay.</p>
<p class="verse0">The plate was made and to him sent,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ev’n by the King’s commandement,</p>
<p class="verse0">And his Comptroller the charge to pay,</p>
<p class="verse0">Hoping ’twould hasten him away:</p>
<p class="verse0">But Charles told him very plain,</p>
<p class="verse0">That he in France would still remain,</p>
<p class="verse0">For he had full right to do so <span class="pad2h">}</span></p>
<p class="verse0">By an alliance treaty long ago <span class="pad2">}</span></p>
<p class="verse0">And this he might let Lewis know. &nbsp;}</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">On this the King wrote straight to Rome,</p>
<p class="verse0">To advise what plan he might assume.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Pope and Pretender did approve,</p>
<p class="verse0">That Charles should from France remove.</p>
<p class="verse0">As the King for him would provide,</p>
<p class="verse0">At Tribourg, a palace to reside,</p>
<p class="verse0">On what yearly pension he should demand,</p>
<p class="verse0">Sent him a Blank from his own hand,</p>
<p class="verse0">To name the sum though e’er so high,</p>
<p class="verse0">Sign’d by’s most Christian Majesty.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Duke de Graves with it was sent,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who begg’d he’d write the sum’s content</p>
<p class="verse0">Into the Blank with his own pen,</p>
<p class="verse0">But down he threw it with disdain,</p>
<p class="verse0">Saying, Bills and Bonds will seem but froth,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">If Sovereigns cannot keep their troth.</p>
<p class="verse0">Then came the Count de Maurepas,</p>
<p class="verse0">With Charles to argument the cause;</p>
<p class="verse0">As it was the King’s express command,</p>
<p class="verse0">That he should forthwith leave the land,</p>
<p class="verse0">If he chus’d not in peace to do it,</p>
<p class="verse0">Their scheme was to compel him to it,</p>
<p class="verse0">That the ministry were greatly struck,</p>
<p class="verse0">At his behaviour and conduct,</p>
<p class="verse0">In stopping the whole of their affairs</p>
<p class="verse0">This is what the Count’s commission bears.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Your Ministry, cry’d he, with disdain,</p>
<p class="verse0">You’ll oblige me, tell your King and them,</p>
<p class="verse0">I’m born, I trust their schemes to break,</p>
<p class="verse0">And how to do’t, I could direct;</p>
<p class="verse0">But, I hope, the time will soon draw on,</p>
<p class="verse0">When that good work it will be done.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">About this time from London came,</p>
<p class="verse0">Two hostages of worthy fame,</p>
<p class="verse0">As pledges of the peace to be,</p>
<p class="verse0">And Articles to ratifie,</p>
<p class="verse0">While the French had none to London sent:</p>
<p class="verse0">At which the Prince a squib did vent,</p>
<p class="verse0">What! is Britain conquer’d, he did say,</p>
<p class="verse0">That their hostages are here away?</p>
<p class="verse0">And is <span class="smcap">French Faith</span> so current grown,</p>
<p class="verse0">That hostages they ask for none?</p>
<p class="verse0">This league shall yet like poor mine go,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which was sworn to a few years ago.</p>
<p class="verse0">This did the Ministry enrage,</p>
<p class="verse0">And nought’s for Charlie but the cage,</p>
<p class="verse0">As the scheme was fully contriv’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">A courier from Rome arriv’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Where the Pope and old Pretender too</p>
<p class="verse0">Did his whole conduct disavow,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ord’ring him forthwith to retire,</p>
<p class="verse0">To which he yet gave a deaf ear;</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">But knowing that he must fall their prey,</p>
<p class="verse0">Order’d his plate and jewels away.</p>
<p class="verse0">His behaviour did through Paris spread,</p>
<p class="verse0">And all did own him, hard bestead.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">Then by the King an order’s sign’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Directly to have him confin’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Twelve hundred guards did close parade,</p>
<p class="verse0">Horse and grenadiers were had</p>
<p class="verse0">All armed and <em>Cap-a-pee</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">Set round the Opera carefullie,</p>
<p class="verse0">The Duke de Biron had command,</p>
<p class="verse0">But loth to take the deed in hand;</p>
<p class="verse0">Caus’d Major Venderville execute,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who did not with much honour do’t.</p>
<p class="verse0">Six lusty ruffians were prepar’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who waiting stood within the guard,</p>
<p class="verse0">And as he entred the Opera door,</p>
<p class="verse0">They seiz’d him fast, and squeezed sore</p>
<p class="verse0">His hands and arms in the squabble,</p>
<p class="verse0">The guards around kept off the rabble,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who had the Prince in great esteem,</p>
<p class="verse0">And wish’d their help him to redeem,</p>
<p class="verse0">His servants and each favourite</p>
<p class="verse0">Were strictly order’d to retreat;</p>
<p class="verse0">Sword and pistols from him did wrest,</p>
<p class="verse0">This comes French vows to at the best.</p>
<p class="verse0">His arms and thighs with cords were knit,</p>
<p class="verse0">And in a coach they have him set,</p>
<p class="verse0">With a Major upon every side;</p>
<p class="verse0">In this posture they made him ride</p>
<p class="verse0">Unto the castle of Vincennes,</p>
<p class="verse0">While soldiers guarded all the lanes,</p>
<p class="verse0">Until that length they did proceed,</p>
<p class="verse0">As there an uproar was indeed;</p>
<p class="verse0">For ’mong the croud it was current told,</p>
<p class="verse0">That he was to the English sold:</p>
<p class="verse0">Some said this, and some said that,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">And thousands told they knew not what.</p>
<p class="verse0">The governor did him imbrace,</p>
<p class="verse0">And cried, “Ah my friend, Alas!</p>
<p class="verse0">“A noble Prince so bound with cord,</p>
<p class="verse0">“Upon my word, I’m sorry for’t.”</p>
<p class="verse0">And then in haste with his own hands,</p>
<p class="verse0">Respectfully unloos’d his bands:</p>
<p class="verse0">But to a dark apartment led him in,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was only ten feet square within,</p>
<p class="verse0">No window to look any way,</p>
<p class="verse0">A sky-light shew’d some peep of day.</p>
<p class="verse0">When he view’d his prison round and round,</p>
<p class="verse0">Said, he’d been worse into Scots ground;</p>
<p class="verse0">Poor Charlie this was hard to <em>thole</em>,</p>
<p class="verse0">To clap thee in a French <em>black-hole</em>!</p>
<p class="verse0">And there he was confin’d to ly,</p>
<p class="verse0">Till to depart he did comply,</p>
<p class="verse0">As the Pope and King James did desire,</p>
<p class="verse0">That he from French ground should retire.</p>
<p class="verse0">When finding that it must be so,</p>
<p class="verse0">He freely did consent to go.</p>
<p class="verse0">Two col’nels went, as it appears,</p>
<p class="verse0">To see him pass the French frontiers:</p>
<p class="verse0">They took the rout to Fountainbleau,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to his dungeon bade adieu,</p>
<p class="verse0">He did not love to be confin’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">So now the peace was fairly sign’d,</p>
<p class="verse0">And Charlie banish’d like a fool,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who was only us’d as a French tool,</p>
<p class="verse0">And to Scotland a scourge and curse,</p>
<p class="verse0">I mean by waste of blood and purse.</p>
<p class="verse0">But in time to come, dear countrymen,</p>
<p class="verse0">O do not do the like again!</p>
<p class="verse0">The Popish oaths ye’ll find a puff,</p>
<p class="verse0">When ye get on the neck a cuff;</p>
<p class="verse0">For in ages past you may see plain,</p>
<p class="verse0">These are the tricks of France and Spain,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">For to be peaceable and good,</p>

<p class="center"><em>A Quaker’s Address to Prince Charles, shewing what was the
Cause and Ground of his Misfortunes.</em></p>


<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">Now Charles, If thou want’st more sorrow,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thou may return if ’twere to-morrow,</p>
<p class="verse0">I know, the Pulpit and the Press</p>
<p class="verse0">Were the great means of thy distress,</p>
<p class="verse0">And thou hadst got no wit to guide it,</p>
<p class="verse0">No Principle thou had provided.</p>
<p class="verse0">Hadst thou, like Oliver appear’d</p>
<p class="verse0">In devout mood, thou might been heard:</p>
<p class="verse0">But a Prince without a principle!</p>
<p class="verse0">What thou couldst be, I cannot tell.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Protestants look’d badly on thee,</p>
<p class="verse0">So many wicked hang upon thee,</p>
<p class="verse0">And of thy forbearers, they plainly tell,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of Popery thou bearst a smell.</p>
<p class="verse0">Thou trustedst nought to ordination,</p>
<p class="verse0">But thought to force a crown and nation.</p>
<p class="verse0">I tell thee, Kings reign not by men,</p>
<p class="verse0">’Tis a higher pow’r, thou’lt find it plain.</p>
<p class="verse0">The Pope, the Pagan, and the Turk,</p>
<p class="verse0">’Tis all by fire and sword they work:</p>
<p class="verse0">We Quakers are of greater merit.</p>
<p class="verse0">We conquer none but by the Spirit;</p>
<p class="verse0">But thou, and each thy like’s a cheat,</p>
<p class="verse0">That pretend to rule the turns of fate,</p>
<p class="verse0">And will fight against the great decree,</p>
<p class="verse0">As of winds and waves would ruler be,&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse0">The Pope pretends to curse and bless,</p>
<p class="verse0">And yet cannot create a Louse,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Nor make a dead beast live again,</p>
<p class="verse0">For all the might he does preten’:</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet claims a power in heav’n and earth,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of judgment here there is a dearth,</p>
<p class="verse0">But O! what madness fills their head?</p>
<p class="verse0">To pray to saints thousand years dead!</p>
<p class="verse0">If dead men had such power to sell,</p>
<p class="verse0">Many of them wou’d been living still.</p>
<p class="verse0">And if those dead men they could hear us,</p>
<p class="verse0">They might sometimes send news to cheer us.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">By Yea and Nay, the Popes are thieves,</p>
<p class="verse0">And he’s as stupid that believes</p>
<p class="verse0">These roguish priests, who pardons sell,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or yet pray back a soul from hell.</p>
<p class="verse0">He’s surely of the devil’s kind,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who thus deludes the vulgar blind;</p>
<p class="verse0">And who adheres to such a college,</p>
<p class="verse0">Will be destroy’d for lake of knowledge,</p>
<p class="verse0">With Beads and Waffers, the Devil’s batter,</p>
<p class="verse0">Your musty Mass, and Holy Water,</p>
<p class="verse0">Wherewith ye blind the souls of men,</p>
<p class="verse0">For to encrease your worldly gain,</p>
<p class="verse0">Done with pretence of holiness:</p>
<p class="verse0">O hypocrites, why live ye thus?</p>
<p class="verse0">You thump, you mump, with face awray,</p>
<p class="verse0">And at one time ye rob and pray,</p>
<p class="verse0">Pretend so much to chastitie,</p>
<p class="verse0">None of your priests can married be,</p>
<p class="verse0">Yet run like rams, and lead lewd lives,</p>
<p class="verse0">Ye’re but a pack of venereal thieves:</p>
<p class="verse0">You practise cuckoldom and whoredom,</p>
<p class="verse0">That innocents have no freedom,</p>
<p class="verse0">Dreading the power of curse and bless,</p>
<p class="verse0">You thus put modesty in distress,</p>
<p class="verse0">Pretending Miracles and Charms,</p>
<p class="verse0">To keep from evil spirits harms,</p>
<p class="verse0">Such as Clover-leaves, and branch of Yew,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">Will keep the devil from man or cow,</p>
<p class="verse0">And that Holy Water has such effect,</p>
<p class="verse0">As make him run and break his neck;</p>
<p class="verse0">Ay, to the vulgar too you’ll tell,</p>
<p class="verse0">Of sending letters to heaven or hell,</p>
<p class="verse0">Bring half burnt souls from Purgatory,</p>
<p class="verse0">For gold you’ll harle them out in hurry,</p>
<p class="verse0">And those who cannot money raise,</p>
<p class="verse0">You’ll do it for butter, beef or cheese;</p>
<p class="verse0">But they may there stay, eternalie,</p>
<p class="verse0">Whose friends will not pay you a fee:</p>
<p class="verse0">I think a stronger delusion,</p>
<p class="verse0">Was never in any ages known,</p>
<p class="verse0">The Turk, the Pagan and the Jew,</p>
<p class="verse0">More mercy have to show than you,</p>
<p class="verse0">Your ceremonies so ye cook,</p>
<p class="verse0">The devil gets none but poor fo’k,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who cannot pay the priest his fee;</p>
<p class="verse0">Accurs’d be such belief for me.&mdash;&mdash;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="verse2">And now, dear Charles, how dost thou think,</p>
<p class="verse0">Such doctrine would in Britain stink,</p>
<p class="verse0">Into a Presbyterian’s nose,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or any who good plain sense knows?</p>
<p class="verse0">Dissenters and we they Quakers call,</p>
<p class="verse0">Protest, they’re not of Israel,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who pretend a power to damn or save,</p>
<p class="verse0">Or bear a rule beyond the grave.</p>
<p class="verse0">All is given us from above,</p>
<p class="verse0">And souls are saved by mere love;</p>
<p class="verse0">But the sp’rit of men, which some hold money,</p>
<p class="verse0">I term it but the devil’s honey,</p>
<p class="verse0">Wherewith you blind the ignorant,</p>
<p class="verse0">And cozen them who hate repent:</p>
<p class="verse0">But as thou profess no principle,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thou might have turn’d a <em>What ye will</em>:</p>
<p class="verse0">But those who no profession own,</p>
<p class="verse0">Are of kin to the beasts alone:</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">They surely have but little wits,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who esteem no God above their guts.</p>
<p class="verse0">What wa’st thou sought? What wa’st thou got?</p>
<p class="verse0">Surely ’twas nothing but thy lot.</p>
<p class="verse0">Though Popes pretend to rule the earth,</p>
<p class="verse0">They cause nought but a sp’ritual dearth,</p>
<p class="verse0">As they can neither rule earth nor sea,</p>
<p class="verse0">Witness what has behappen’d thee:</p>
<p class="verse0">It surely makes your Pope a knave,</p>
<p class="verse0">To pretend a pow’r beyond the grave:</p>
<p class="verse0">Had his apostolic pow’r been true,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thou wou’dst been King of Britain now.</p>
<p class="verse0">Wert thou a Protestant in heart,</p>
<p class="verse0">I’d wish thee very well in part;</p>
<p class="verse0">But the last wish thoul’t get from me,</p>
<p class="verse0">Is, God keep our land of Pop’ry free!</p>
<p class="verse0">May the throne continue in Protestant race,</p>
<p class="verse0">And ne’er a Papist fill his place.</p>
<p class="verse0">Thus saith to thee an honest Quaker,</p>
<p class="verse0">Thou ne’er shalt here be a partaker:</p>
<p class="verse0">For all Rome’s plots and magic spell,</p>
<p class="verse0">’Tis seldom now they prosper well,</p>
<p class="verse0">Her days of witchcraft are near run,</p>
<p class="verse0">Few <em>Ave’s</em> or <em>Te Deum’s</em> sung,</p>
<p class="verse0">A Mass that’s mumbled o’er in haste,</p>
<p class="verse0">Spoke in the language of the beast,</p>
<p class="verse0">Which but by few is understood,</p>
<p class="verse0">Poor chaff instead of sp’ritual food:</p>
<p class="verse0">But ignorance, the Papists say,</p>
<p class="verse0">Is unto heaven the nearest way:</p>
<p class="verse0">But, O ye wretches, this I doubt,</p>
<p class="verse0">While you the sp’ritual light keep out,</p>
<p class="verse0">And teach so freely, and off hand,</p>
<p class="verse0">To break the very Lord’s command,</p>
<p class="verse0">And on no other things lay hold;</p>
<p class="verse0">But trust the priest, and give him gold.</p>
<p class="verse0">All sins by them are pardoned,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
<p class="verse0">So by the nose the poor are led;</p>
<p class="verse0">Not blinded nations or ideots,</p>
<p class="verse0">But the rich, learned reprobates,</p>
<p class="verse0">Who will not from sinning hold,</p>
<p class="verse0">As long’s they have one bit of gold.</p>
<p class="verse0">Wo will be to such priests, I say:</p>
<p class="verse0">For hell’s prepar’d for such as they.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Impeachments" id="The_Impeachments"></a><span class="hidden">The Impeachments</span></h3>

<p>⁂ The Impeachments against Lord <span class="smcap">George Murray</span>,
and <span class="smcap">John Murray</span> Secretary, accused of treachery by the
Public, are here omitted, thought in some respects to be
groundless, at least of Lord <span class="smcap">George</span>: For there is never a
Battle lost, but the Commander gets the Blame, and when one
is won, the Commander gets all the Praise, as if the Soldiers
had done nothing: And it is further observed, after the
loss of a Battle, it is the cry of the Public and the run-away
Soldiers, <span class="smcap">We are sold, We are sold</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following <span class="smcap">Copy</span>, mentioned by Lords Kilmarnock and
Balmerino, on the day of their execution, is here inserted <em>verbatim</em>.&mdash;&mdash;The
Public are left to judge whether it is spurious
or not, as the Author does not pretend to judge in the affair:
Only it was judged spurious by Duke William himself, and
several officers, who knew the order of war.</p>

<p class="negin2">Copy <em>of the</em> REBELS’ ORDERS before the <span class="smcap">Battle</span> of
<span class="smcap">Culloden</span>, (<em>said to be</em>) found in the Pocket of one of
the Prisoners.</p>

<p class="center">Parole, <em>Roy Jaques</em>.</p>

<p>“IT is his <span class="smcap">Royal Highness’</span> positive orders, that every
person attach himself to some Corps of the Army, and
remain with the Corps night and day, until the Battle and
Pursuit be finally over: And to give no Quarters to the
<span class="smcap">Elector’s</span> Troops, on any account whatsoever.&mdash;&mdash;This regards
the Foot, as well as the Horse.&mdash;&mdash;The Order of Battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
is to be given to every General Officer and Commander
of a Regiment or Squadron.</p>

<p>“IT is required and expected of each Individual in the
Army, as well Officer as Soldier, that he keep the Post he
shall be allotted: And if any man turn his back to run away,
the next behind such man is to shoot him.</p>

<p>“NO body, upon pain of death, is to strip the slain, or
plunder, until the battle is over.&mdash;&mdash;The Highlanders to be
in Kilts, and no body to throw away their Guns.”</p>

<p class="fs70">[The following is what may be termed a ‘Chap-book Version’ of <cite>John Highlandman’s
Remarks on Glasgow</cite>. It is taken from a chap-book published
anonymously in Glasgow in 1823. In no material respect does it differ from the
other copies still to be found. M‘Vean was the first to attribute the verses
to Graham. The assumption has generally been that in point of time this is one
Graham’s earliest productions, after his <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>, and it is
certainly the most popular of his metrical pieces. It furnishes an interesting description
of Glasgow about the middle of last century.]</p>

<p class="fs70">[Stenhouse, in his <cite>Lyric Poetry and Music of Scotland</cite>, suggests that <cite>Had Awa
Frae Me, Donald</cite>, was probably written by the same hand as <cite>Turnimspike</cite>. In
view of the strong likeness which exists between the two pieces, and the fact that
no author has been found for the lines on the following pages, we have no hesitation
in admitting them among works probably written by Graham. The view
here given is reprinted from&mdash;‘The Black Bird: a choice collection of the most
celebrated songs. Few of which are to be found in any collection. By William
Hunter, Philo-Architectonicæ. Edinburgh: Printed by J. Bruce and Company:
And sold by John Moir, Book-Binder in Bell’s Wynd. <span class="fs80">MDCCLXIV.</span>’ It is also in

to Glasgow, his native city, and erected opposite the Tontine, at the Cross, in
1735. It was cast in Holland. The classical style of dress, including primitive
sandals, in which the King is represented, gave rise to the idea in ‘John Highlandman’s’
mind that His Majesty was a ‘poor man.’</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_44" id="Footnote_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> The old guardhouse, in the Trongate, at the foot of the Candleriggs. Like
many of the houses in Glasgow at the time, it had a colonnaded front, which
projected into the street, and made it a feature of the city. Here the citizens took
duty by turns, for these were the days when policemen were unknown.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_45" id="Footnote_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> It is on record that a clockmaker in the Trongate had at that time in his
window a clock, on which a figure of the ‘Deil’ was shown as ‘chapping’ the
hours.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_46" id="Footnote_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> There were several roperies in the vicinity of the Broomielaw.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_47" id="Footnote_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> The reference is to the Black Bull Inn&mdash;‘the cow’s husband’&mdash;situated at the
West Port, which was then in the Trongate, at the head of Stockwell Street. It
was one of the most famous hostleries in the west country.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_48" id="Footnote_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> Rather an obscure reference, but it may probably find an explanation in the
following statement in Fairholt’s <cite>Costume in England</cite>, p. 567:&mdash;‘Feather muffs
are mentioned in Anstey’s <cite>New Bath Guide</cite>, and became fashionable in George
III.’s reign.’ Another alternative is that it may refer to what were then known as
Spanish fans.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_49" id="Footnote_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> Probably pattens, then in common use.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_50" id="Footnote_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> A long drawn out description of a sedan chair. Carriages had not yet come
into vogue. The first private carriage seen in Glasgow belonged to Allan Dreghorn,
a timber merchant and carpenter and joiner, who built one for himself in
1752.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_51" id="Footnote_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> Perhaps a reference to the ‘ties’ of the lady’s bonnet.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_52" id="Footnote_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> The two stanzas within brackets are not in several chap-book copies. The
many verbal differences indicate that attempts have been made to touch up the
song, but the absence of any very early copy of it, makes it impossible to obtain
an absolutely pure text. These alterations, however, in no way affect the narrative.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_53" id="Footnote_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> A wonderful rendering of ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cessio bonorum</i>.’</p></div></div>
